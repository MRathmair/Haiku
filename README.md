This repository contains a notebook which trains a Transformer model to generate haikus [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiku] automatically.
The architecture is precisely the Decoder part of the model from the 'Attention is all you need' paper [https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762].
The model is based on a dataset from kaggle uploaded by the user bfbarry [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bfbarry/haiku-dataset]
