delicate savage <LINE1> you'll never hold the cinder <LINE2> but still you will burn 
our destination <LINE1> the skyline of this city <LINE2> shining horizon 
a splash and a cry <LINE1>  words pulled from the riverside <LINE2>  dried in the hot sun 
hurt but poised for war <LINE1> sturdy in crestfallen slumps <LINE2> warrior spirit 
steamy mist rising <LINE1> rocks receiving downward crash <LINE2> as the jungle weeps 
a sultry wine night <LINE1>  spent with a beautiful girl <LINE2>  brash kiss ends smooth jazz 
you were broken glass <LINE1> but i touched you even though <LINE2> i knew it would hurt 
say not that i have <LINE1> fled from the world but that the <LINE2> world has fled from me 
eyes dance with firelight <LINE1> the moon and i are lovers <LINE2> the spiteful sun dies 
i woke up today <LINE1> i wanted to write a song <LINE2> i wrote a haiku 
why do you hate me <LINE1>  bored of my dumb brain <LINE2>  tired of this haiku 
know when to quit friend <LINE1> no time to waste in this space <LINE2> live well to the end 
if only your luck <LINE1> had spiked back then in vegas <LINE2> my life is misfortune 
ritual to relax <LINE1> has evolved over the time <LINE2> the effects profound 
gazing upon plains <LINE1> a loving wind warms my nose <LINE2> the sun behind me 
the lion limped out <LINE1> and flipped his tail at march when <LINE2> fleecy frolicked in 
your words are wounding <LINE1> your tongue a bloody scalpel <LINE2> your aim perfection 
time stopped when you spoke <LINE1>  my chest heaved my breath shortened <LINE2>  our candle burnt out 
empty bleeding womb <LINE1>  stark white faces sad eyes say <LINE2>  sorry for your loss 
a sparking of stems <LINE1> ignited the blazing for <LINE2> red maple torches 
it ebbs and flows now <LINE1> my will a rock in the swell <LINE2> i sink beneath it 
finally they're gone <LINE1> my chaotic family <LINE2> now peace and silence 
coming up with poem <LINE1> takes some consideration <LINE2> this is the result 
tragedy it seemed <LINE1> awakening it was though <LINE2> happiness will come 
always doomscrolling <LINE1>  very stressful times indeed <LINE2>  need someone to lead 
searching the ashes <LINE1> finding questions unanswered <LINE2> leaving with charred hands 
your heart is a dead <LINE1>  fortress with walls that swallow <LINE2>  my cries to be free 
dreams of youth <LINE1> love realized bridged the gaps <LINE2> forwardeyes raised 
care must be taken <LINE1> risk always necessary <LINE2> treading the needle 
dark roof cavity <LINE1> rodent highway or phantoms <LINE2> scratch scrape and shuffle 
roses are not red <LINE1> violets never completely blue <LINE2> kitty is the one 
i just need some time <LINE1> for rest and healing and change <LINE2> i'll get better soon 
river wash my pain <LINE1> the winds softly sing your name <LINE2> all flows subliminally 
trump is really bad <LINE1> he will end america <LINE2> world war three is real 
she was so broken <LINE1>  he pieced her back together <LINE2>  and broke her himself 
smile forevermore <LINE1> mother nature will laugh back <LINE2> now my world is bright 
my first day of cake <LINE1> what a fabulous feeling <LINE2> another blue cheese 
real roses have thorns <LINE1> they teach appreciation <LINE2> without holding on 
all the bees and trees <LINE1> won't even briefly lament <LINE2> human extinction 
i can float away <LINE1> into the deep dark abyss <LINE2> welcomed by the stars 
my mind betrays me <LINE1>  each night by dreaming of him <LINE2>  nowhere left to run 
washing the dishes <LINE1> thinking about a haiku <LINE2> words flow like water 
prayer at the start <LINE1> prayer with each twist and turn <LINE2> prayer filled with thanks 
worms in a circle <LINE1> circle in the infinite <LINE2> infinite in the 
waves roll west to east <LINE1> observed by october trees <LINE2> echoes of a crow 
dark room and moonlight <LINE1> fingers reek of nicotine <LINE2> another cold night 
crystals billowing in an ocean <LINE1>  a fairy guides a herd of pollen <LINE2>  happy frogs croaking 
take a look through me <LINE1> i'm essentially empty <LINE2> man the breathing husk 
junkie ghouls linger <LINE1> near the kmart sepulchre <LINE2> new necropolis 
she lifts her ass high <LINE1> where she looks her gaze demands <LINE2> spank me harder please 
clatter of bottles <LINE1> and the dense breath of a man <LINE2> she prays for daylight 
smoke drifts doubt aside <LINE1>  opportunity in hand <LINE2>  another face plant 
small steps to healing <LINE1> years of damage to repair <LINE2> i am in no rush 
i lay here in bed <LINE1> my thoughts full of fear and dread <LINE2> i wish i were dead 
you take this away <LINE1> i will destroy your message <LINE2> god is dementia 
money the force here <LINE1> drives us and intertwines us <LINE2> break us from this bond 
obvious artist <LINE1> no signature required for <LINE2> landscapes in the fall 
light or dark inside <LINE1> songbirds sing in the sunshine <LINE2> owls glide true at night 
i can't get up <LINE1> elephant on my chest <LINE2> i can barely breath 
it strange how you can <LINE1> surround yourself with people <LINE2> yet still feel alone 
in one swift movement <LINE1>  a heron swallows a fish <LINE2>  and then flies away 
white sands on the beach <LINE1> and pink petals off a branch <LINE2> drifting in the wind 
sacramentsyour gift <LINE1> opened they have all i need <LINE2> your love so perfect 
my cheeks are sandy <LINE1>  square pants star lives under rock <LINE2>  alaskan bull worm 
trickling water <LINE1> dense groves of veridian <LINE2> aged stones half buried 
i wish to send you <LINE1>  a video of a crow <LINE2>  sucks for you i'm blocked 
no one dies today <LINE1> not inside my influence <LINE2> and not on my watch 
the calm river flows <LINE1>  branches lurch in the waters <LINE2>  ripples tell the tale 
test of faith <LINE1> today i will face it <LINE2> empowered by love 
live your fantasies <LINE1> your dreams can be memories <LINE2> just stay out of jail 
what we leave behind <LINE1> is how we are remembered <LINE2> plastic is garbage 
a turning point reached <LINE1> decisions and decisions <LINE2> to be bold beyond 
you were turned over <LINE1> rainbow sheened worlds floating free <LINE2> your bnbbles poured out 
yesterday lit up the sky <LINE1> when darkness comes <LINE2> moon will guide you 
i met a poacher <LINE1> asked him why he liked to kill <LINE2> just kidding shot him 
hopelessly naive <LINE1> pining 'til the crack of dawn <LINE2> my bell never rings 
progress is all gone <LINE1>  i gave into my vices <LINE2>  time to start over 
my grief counselor <LINE1> was excellent and just died <LINE2> i don't feel a thing 
contemplating time <LINE1> for how slow everyday feels <LINE2> this year ended quick 
words fall short of you <LINE1>  beauty gorgeous not enough <LINE2>  you inspire me 
in love with bundy <LINE1> death just around the corner <LINE2> laugh into the sea 
why is it so hard <LINE1> just to get a job right now <LINE2> paying living wage 
foot in a puddle <LINE1> a forgotten parking lot <LINE2> good place to daydream 
bifurcated hams <LINE1> just jack off my fag penis <LINE2> ignore the straight one 
normally i'd sleep <LINE1> but sleeping won't save me now <LINE2> not from this heartbreak 
i just kissed a grill <LINE1> had to prove that i'm not gay <LINE2> shit i'm gunna puke 
listen she's breathless <LINE1> look into her bloodshot eyes <LINE2> should i let go yet 
and when they landed <LINE1> after waves of fire reigned down <LINE2> i knew we had lost 
the river bed was <LINE1> throwing off the cover and <LINE2> broke the winter quilt 
seething emotions <LINE1> churning thoughts feelings askew <LINE2> all i blurt is hi 
will we reconnect  <LINE1>  positive thoughts ensure it  <LINE2>  we will reconnect 
i searched north to south <LINE1>  despondency was my spoils <LINE2>  rescued by your smile 
a peaceful sunrise <LINE1> discovers the idle streets <LINE2> the drunkard blinded 
little by little <LINE1> exceptions never met <LINE2> sand slips through my hands 
a secluded place <LINE1> alone away from all else <LINE2> i long to live in 
a tap from winter <LINE1> reminded the cars in a <LINE2> whirling of petals 
boil these dry leaves <LINE1> pour the water in my cup <LINE2> you have spilled the tea 
the empty ink pen <LINE1> so lonely on my dresser <LINE2> begs me to use it 
twinkling stars above <LINE1> like golden fish in a pond <LINE2> withdrawn swim through time 
letter of request <LINE1> it is against company <LINE2> policy to die 
rob really did it <LINE1> a new city a new job <LINE2> two holes in the ground 
it has betrayed me <LINE1> heart pumping eyes wide awake <LINE2> sleep i summon thee 
beautiful immense <LINE1> poseidon like the sea <LINE2> washes o'er my soul 
hidden strength built up <LINE1> from years of struggle and pain <LINE2> you are now mighty 
get rid of your junk <LINE1> and you will finally have <LINE2> room for your treasure 
this shit just got real <LINE1> a big promotion ahead <LINE2> it's mine if i want 
endlessness outweighed <LINE1> as a feather falls to earth <LINE2> lifted by the breeze 
vast existence we <LINE1> god gravity is to be <LINE2> universal truth 
six months intertwined <LINE1> tangled bodies under sheets <LINE2> knot slowly fraying 
i look for shelter <LINE1>  and find a new hiding place <LINE2>  underneath the pines 
two unsteady feet <LINE1>  steel themselves for another <LINE2>  failed attempt to fly 
man and the machine <LINE1> how are you today but just <LINE2> spits out a receipt 
hey ups guy <LINE1> what does that red sticker say <LINE2> it's fragile dumb dumb 
one on one time wow <LINE1> each moment so close perfect <LINE2> once again lord thanks 
today is the day <LINE1> tomorrow is now today <LINE2> today is the day 
mercury poisoned <LINE1> the kid went to therapy <LINE2> and misdiagnosed 
frost on the river <LINE1> all boats have been pulled in tight <LINE2> chicks are home to roost 
a battered housewife <LINE1> hiding out in her kitchen <LINE2> prepares tempura 
loosely braided stems <LINE1> a dainty crown for a queen <LINE2> small yellow stained hands 
long day in summer <LINE1>  bright sky warm wind yet now <LINE2>  storm is coming 
when you told me that <LINE1>  you had three fewer children <LINE2>  who was sacrificed 
ah bonjour tristesse <LINE1> i am emotionally <LINE2> unavailable 
i run far away <LINE1>  nothing but the essentials <LINE2>  keeping my friends safe 
people's dilemma <LINE1>  in the last breath of freedom <LINE2>  thunderous applause 
blood and tears dripping <LINE1> energy drained passion gained <LINE2> exist profoundly 
we live in a plague <LINE1> a time most dire indeed <LINE2> we will hold the line 
an ancient city <LINE1> silent sands consume his name <LINE2> ozymandias 
sometimes it's just there <LINE1> like a lead weight on your chest <LINE2> compressing your soul 
weed in the garden <LINE1> gentle squeeze of the trigger <LINE2> death of the haiku 
no real purpose here <LINE1>  where is my life going now <LINE2>  fuck i want to die 
shade of a tall tree <LINE1> becomes a welcoming breeze <LINE2> breath tranquility 
clear was your anger <LINE1> stranger how i prayed for you <LINE2> find the love you seek 
i cannot think straight <LINE1> i feel alone completely <LINE2>  irreparable 
you're counting the days <LINE1> segue to weeks months and years <LINE2> inevitable 
i love you so much <LINE1> you are the best on the earth <LINE2> daddy i love you 
i cannot rise see <LINE1> i am not bread all day long <LINE2> laying in my bed 
she's a burrito <LINE1> always getting stuffed so full <LINE2> get it she cucks me 
communal silence <LINE1> we all listen together <LINE2> our creator speaks 
howling wind rattles <LINE1> the broken summer awning <LINE2>  that broke from the wind 
tired of smart decisions <LINE1> artificial hapiness <LINE2> nobody's perfect 
i dreamt i was dead <LINE1> a dark curtain between sides <LINE2> i was asleep right 
three in the morning <LINE1> times ticking by as i scroll <LINE2> i'm craving for sleep 
joy did it pierce you <LINE1> love burning our hearts and souls <LINE2> hope filled my soul 
fellas hangin' out <LINE1> be my homosexual <LINE2> just don't tell my wife 
googling symptoms <LINE1> turns computer off pours wine <LINE2> no cure for the blues 
gentle ocean tide <LINE1> the ripple traveled all span <LINE2> it has reached it's end 
shes an outdoor cat <LINE1> reminiscing her fifth life <LINE2> illuminous moon 
defenses are high <LINE1> positions deeply entrenched <LINE2> fighting with my boss 
she makes that cough like <LINE1> pirates on the horizon <LINE2> already too late 
clouds drop me their time <LINE1> quarter to soaked in wet dreams <LINE2> thanks for everything 
window cracked open <LINE1> hoping for fresh morning air <LINE2> smells like skunk butt now 
auttum leaves <LINE1>  sigh of relief <LINE2> be free with me 
dead men sing no songs <LINE1> but smart conspirators know <LINE2> silence is a note 
a son of lightning <LINE1> roots run deep beneath my feet <LINE2>  petals bleached clear white 
life is still quite sweet <LINE1> even in times of sadness <LINE2> let me breathe again 
is it possible <LINE1> to distill out the spaces <LINE2> and leave just the time 
holes in the wall now <LINE1> where pretty things used to be <LINE2> you are still with me 
my happiness is complet <LINE1> what on earth one more <LINE2> mustache whisker inhaled 
tiptoeing softly <LINE1> to lay down near the fire <LINE2> its old bones now warm 
just as gray clouds burst <LINE1> and light rains whisper downward <LINE2> i yawn contently 
its windy again this morning <LINE1>  and everyone i know <LINE2>  will fucking die 
pushed out of the nest <LINE1>  now realizing that i can fly <LINE2>  thank you for leaving 
the weekend was packed <LINE1>  now back to work tomorrow <LINE2>  my life has not slowed 
in the neighborhood <LINE1> signs divide the red and blue <LINE2> will this ever end 
fighting a typhoon <LINE1> relentless i press on but <LINE2> i can't stand the rain 
this haiku was born <LINE1> while huckleberry gummies <LINE2> swam in my belly 
have not been outside <LINE1> since early february <LINE2> summer days please stay 
a flower blossoms <LINE1> uncurls its naked petals <LINE2> pours in the sun crunch 
paycheck spent on snacks <LINE1> a belly full of dismay <LINE2> sweats like fat elvis 
let's get lost tonight <LINE1> escape the world and we'll find <LINE2> home in each other 
i should have proposed <LINE1>  you look stunning in your gown <LINE2> always be happy 
this still feels like home <LINE1> i have been gone for nine years <LINE2> time to leave again 
knock knock on the door <LINE1> little monsters with blue claws <LINE2> digging for candy 
oil sizzles in the pan <LINE1> content the stomach rumbles <LINE2> what joy good food is 
morose until i <LINE1> make my soul sing a song back <LINE2> will you forget me 
scurry lurking bird <LINE1> this sugar is not your life <LINE2> do not be tempted 
worn faded and stained <LINE1> the rag dries the artist's brush <LINE2> it lives its purpose 
full journal pages <LINE1> flipped to cover yesterday <LINE2> where do the days go 
you just lost your job <LINE1> have you friend ever been fired <LINE2> from your family 
pulling from the front <LINE1> a fresh toilet paper roll <LINE2> later from the rear 
a single note plays <LINE1> the tune linked with piano <LINE2> push the middle c 
burning unread words <LINE1> flame consumes your memory <LINE2> fiercer than our late love 
withering slowly <LINE1> life paints me with broad brushes <LINE2> a dead leaf tumbling 
i believe in me <LINE1> yet i stand in my own way <LINE2> i will carry on 
a landscape pastiche <LINE1> smears of blue green and yellow <LINE2> monet dreamed for me 
coins shook from her hair <LINE1> in a midas touch with the <LINE2> leaves changing to gold 
mountain range of clouds <LINE1> makes the sunrise last longer <LINE2> gold crown at its peak 
why is it that death <LINE1> will only lend what life is <LINE2> compelled to borrow 
fatherhood issues <LINE1>  peed out diaper late at night <LINE2>  have another drink 
social networking <LINE1> a soapbox for everyone <LINE2> can we survive it 
my head is burnt out <LINE1> with all this context switching <LINE2> try again later 
never connected <LINE1> nothing makes one feel alone <LINE2> like that admission 
dancing in the rain <LINE1> soaked but feeling joyful <LINE2> i love this moment 
winter's breath so cold <LINE1> numbing fingers inside gloves <LINE2> and ears under hats 
am i getting one <LINE1> asked a man in nantucket <LINE2> or just giving one 
got a new hoopty <LINE1> cruising so phat down the block <LINE2> how much were those rims 
holding on too long  <LINE1> is just fear of letting go <LINE2> i can't release you 
the writing removed <LINE1> no body bags to be seen <LINE2> death of the haiku 
facing my demons <LINE1> spiritual redemption <LINE2> freedom to be me 
be kind to yourself <LINE1> not just in the present but <LINE2> past and future too 
perfect is the son <LINE1> perfection of me his will <LINE2> praise you lord jesus 
my glass is empty <LINE1> the bathroom tap will not do <LINE2> kitchen tastes better 
the shine of the moon <LINE1> and the glimmer of the stars <LINE2> damn mortality 
the words that i use <LINE1>  have been structured to form a <LINE2>  haiku poem 
haiku is an art <LINE1>  painting landscape dreams of gold <LINE2>  for minds to behold 
message read loud clear <LINE1> words embrace repulse hard work <LINE2> in these jobless times 
until the sunrise <LINE1> moonlit trails ride the ridge line <LINE2> until the sunrise 
this was a pit stop <LINE1> a temporary refuge <LINE2> you were good to me 
left out and denied <LINE1> never really liked it here <LINE2> bound to be alone 
say haiku out loud <LINE1> doesn't it sound like a sneeze <LINE2> haiku gesundheit 
wound healednow returned <LINE1> will i be rid of it lord <LINE2> trusting in our love 
oppressive july <LINE1> smothering sweaty sleepers <LINE2> distant thunder mocks 
if this peace is real <LINE1> let me collect my thoughts quick <LINE2> then all life is fake 
i love you she says <LINE1> resting her hand on his heart <LINE2> afraid he'll wake up 
i couldn't fix you <LINE1> i had no choice but to run <LINE2> your demons followed 
here i lie awake <LINE1> wanting to sleep and thinking <LINE2> of sleep sweet sweet sleep 
gentle rain falling <LINE1> the roof sings it's soothing song <LINE2> sleep comes easily 
i was plummeting <LINE1> with no parachute no end <LINE2> but you gave me one 
i feel so carefree <LINE1> though i am riddled with doubt <LINE2> a puzzle unsolved 
growth for the sake of <LINE1> growth is ideology <LINE2> of the cancer cell 
knew the night was off <LINE1> hand after hand confirmed this <LINE2> folded then i left 
please pick up the poop <LINE1> made a good impression then <LINE2> flung it off the trail 
songs ever calling <LINE1> such are the world's temptations <LINE2> silence needed lord 
the old creaky barn <LINE1> that once raised a family <LINE2> is full of spiders 
insulated cold  <LINE1> there is nothing here but cold <LINE2> encapsulated 
i just bought a duck <LINE1> not kidding his name's richard <LINE2> he is fucking cute 
american shores <LINE1> while canadian neighbors <LINE2> brood on beaver lodge 
if you don't know what <LINE1> to do with yourself then do <LINE2> something for a friend 
standing on the wall <LINE1>  watching the frost ice and snow <LINE2>  winter is coming 
time heals is that true <LINE1> gears motionless as i watch <LINE2> the seconds rewind 
sometimes we fall down <LINE1> sometimes we pick others up <LINE2> sometimes we move on 
summer betrayal <LINE1> the cold shoulder of autumn <LINE2> with jackets for june 
repeat after me <LINE1> freedom is not found like this <LINE2> freedom is not found 
left or right click now <LINE1> left click unless specified <LINE2> left or right click now 
don't make seas out of <LINE1> rivers lost in the hourglass <LINE2> though hardships we face 
blue jeans sunlight air <LINE1> warm today and i miss you <LINE2> we'll breathe moonlight soon 
acorn drops from tree <LINE1> but trees can not produce corn <LINE2> i am amaized 
the olive branch wakes <LINE1> no good deed goes unpunished <LINE2> frost covers its buds 
bad news from every side <LINE1> depression lurks in the dark  <LINE2> a silent battle 
wishing life away <LINE1> now near the end of my life <LINE2> let me start again 
successful con man <LINE1> still playing by their rules bro <LINE2>  smiles then drive away 
autumn winds arrive <LINE1> parading through the tree tops <LINE2> leaf by leaf applause 
in the dead of winter <LINE1> sleepwalk on my balcony <LINE2> cold feet in my bed 
staring he stares back <LINE1> wonders how he became me <LINE2> then brushes his teeth 
the texas cliche <LINE1> doesn't fit in the garage <LINE2> my new manivan 
i miss your presence <LINE1> all these memories you left <LINE2> fill me with longing 
falling apart now <LINE1> holding myself together <LINE2> faster said than done 
fish and honeybees <LINE1> see how they are related <LINE2> butterfly effect 
second vodka in <LINE1>  twilight zone of consciousness <LINE2>  my reality 
floating in stasis <LINE1> suspended animation <LINE2> ready to resume 
welcome to the void <LINE1> drift into black nothingness <LINE2>  time and space dissolved 
better hard to love <LINE1> than easy to abandon <LINE2> brutal poetry 
frost on the blood moon <LINE1>  hidden beauty in the sky <LINE2>  her cheek against mine 
van gogh's frightening <LINE1>  clarity was the least he <LINE2>  could say of nature 
ironically so <LINE1>  it is solely beside death <LINE2>  can there exist life 
summertime rain <LINE1>  dusting off muddy tulips <LINE2> brand new yellow dress 
if you introspect <LINE1> you may recall your actions <LINE2> discard assumptions 
the people i knew <LINE1>  whatever happened to them <LINE2>  do they think of me 
home a quiet house <LINE1> jigsaw pieces fit nicely <LINE2> sipping my earl gray 
past the coral reefs <LINE1> disguised on the ocean floor <LINE2> an octopus waits 
believing in what <LINE1> birds empty hands sisyphus <LINE2> my toes in the grass 
hanging on to stars <LINE1> even tho their light has died <LINE2> a canyon of screams 
hey up high he says <LINE1> slap now go down low this time <LINE2> too slow betrayal 
sights sounds smells routines <LINE1> comfort but i choose to leave <LINE2> may i do your will 
i found my purpose <LINE1> inside the written words of <LINE2> my innermost self 
there is never enough time <LINE1> to appreciate <LINE2> a good burrito 
pause for effect <LINE1> respect for your weaknesses <LINE2> some words of wisdom 
fears of your future <LINE1> become the ghosts of your past <LINE2> friendly little ghosts 
you can't ask for life <LINE1> existance forced upon you <LINE2> it's not free or fair 
life ambidextrous  <LINE1> countin money in my right <LINE2> slang white by left wrist 
my work kills my soul <LINE1>  why oh why am i here late <LINE2>  come on lucky numbers 
butthole eye puckers <LINE1> takes one last cigarette drag <LINE2> incorrigible 
crinkling wrapper <LINE1> dog instantly in kitchen <LINE2> hope springs eternal 
when shall spring arrive <LINE1> winter stays unwelcomed here <LINE2> smothering all warmth 
so insane lives lost <LINE1> tears flow hope in mercy love <LINE2> lord heal our deep wounds 
busy bee busy <LINE1> buzzing between blooming bulbs <LINE2> burden but bounty 
watching the leaves fall <LINE1>  waiting for the first snowfall <LINE2>  wishing for summer 
the falling rain stops <LINE1>  in its passing memory <LINE2>  reflection of sky 
the water submits <LINE1> victory without defeat <LINE2> beautiful laughter 
good night good night all <LINE1> parting my way to sorrow <LINE2> til it be morrow 
sweet sharp saudade <LINE1> the hair ties lie silently <LINE2> my furry best friend 
three in the morning <LINE1> i'm up reading strange comments <LINE2> reddit lullaby

keep your trash and change <LINE1>  in the same pocket for they <LINE2>  are one and the same 
campfire set aglow <LINE1> embers soar past moon soaked pines <LINE2> dusk cricket's opus 
down these wooden steps <LINE1> leaves crunch under dusty boots <LINE2> steep this hiking trail 
how can a movie <LINE1> about sex and bondage <LINE2> be so damn boring 
the big bang <LINE1> unfinished pattern still unfolds <LINE2> illusion of freedom 
the wind writes poems <LINE1> scrawls curving brushstrokes of snow <LINE2> and reads them aloud 
no taco today <LINE1> mondays will not be the same <LINE2> broken paradigm 
sleep is resourceful <LINE1>  she turns tables to pillows <LINE2>  during maths exams

all sentient beings <LINE1> deserve care and good treatment <LINE2> act with compassion 
morning came slowly <LINE1>  and i grew weary watching <LINE2>  the world turning blue 
blinded by your light <LINE1>  makes need to fight for the right <LINE2>  to keep my own sight 
frozen winter treat <LINE1> made together with grandma <LINE2> some vanilla snow 
i sit here all day <LINE1> just trying to look busy <LINE2> purgatory sucks 
years pass so quickly <LINE1> stumbling on this pilgrimage <LINE2> faith hope lovebeacons 
in the laundry room <LINE1> always washing black with blue <LINE2> an absence of mood 
empty the tomb <LINE1> filled with faith and hope <LINE2> such joy alleluia 
wanderlust suits us <LINE1> yearning for home as we sit <LINE2> around the table 
i have amnesia <LINE1> but i really love haikus <LINE2> i have amnesia 
yards butted heads in <LINE1> elegant vs cartoon <LINE2> the fence as victor 
unpaved tree lined road <LINE1> tattered farm in the distance <LINE2> sweet tea on the porch 
the sun sets early <LINE1> shadows outstretch and lengthen <LINE2> darkness comes too fast 
i met a woman <LINE1>  we fell in love when we met <LINE2>  butterflies always 
i'll propose a toast <LINE1> raise it for my self control <LINE2> crawling on the floor 
amazon package <LINE1> don't remember what it is <LINE2> must not need it much 
lowly pawn am i <LINE1> filled with hope for victory <LINE2> trusting in your moves 
flowers are in bloom <LINE1> leaves coming to life turn green <LINE2> finally spring came 
progress so they say <LINE1> is often moving backward <LINE2> in a forward way 
at the firehouse <LINE1> bukkake for my buttocks <LINE2> just two frosty globes 
christmas all year round <LINE1> santa claus indiana <LINE2> i believe in him 
dead tree in the middle <LINE1> surrounded by life waiting <LINE2> for returning life 
on the horizon <LINE1> a white sail journeys towards <LINE2> the country of clouds 
these old memories <LINE1> they are too perfect to keep <LINE2> help me not look back 
overhead the sun <LINE1> blazing down on wilting man <LINE2> plants wilt as well 
like a great river <LINE1> the years carve into your face <LINE2> yet your eyes beam love 
such encouragement <LINE1> your smile invigorated <LINE2> my soul filled with joy 
salmon to silver <LINE1> the ripples shimmer it back <LINE2> geese drip on the beach 
money is evil <LINE1>  currency is disaster <LINE2>  all things should be free 
annihilation <LINE1> of the wicked will commence <LINE2> in their darkened shrines 
i start up my life <LINE1> i wait for it to begin <LINE2> already ending 
wailing winter blues <LINE1> so caught up in my problems <LINE2> summer set me free 
you say i'm a catch <LINE1> but if only you say it <LINE2> is it even true 
if only the sun would rest <LINE1> if only the nights were long enough <LINE2> if only life would be any different 
here aluminum <LINE1> just over the pond england <LINE2> aluminum 
coughing is painful <LINE1> come watch me exhale daggers <LINE2> i hope i don't die 
sleeping for eight hours <LINE1> good break for your mental health <LINE2> body recovers 
a word but whispered <LINE1> once a dream infinity <LINE2> now oblivion 
that fire in your pants <LINE1> when you're homosexual <LINE2> holy mackerel 
mellifluous flow <LINE1> movement expresses passion <LINE2> others envious 
yes throwing acid <LINE1>  on the face of some models <LINE2>  is ethically sound 
songbird jives the wind <LINE1> freeflow compost remembers <LINE2> dank marijuana 
staring at my screen <LINE1> php spaghetti code <LINE2> who oh it was me 
i miss our old talks <LINE1> now you feel like a stranger <LINE2> what happened to us 
unexpected times <LINE1> take the opportunity <LINE2> to build something new 
bright morning smiles <LINE1> rocked to sleep each goodnight <LINE2> long awaited babe 
razor like a ring <LINE1> a marriage to a stranger <LINE2> annulled in a stitch 
stopping the dial to <LINE1> drop sunflower children in <LINE2> time for september 
poems are metaphors <LINE1> words in symphony a song <LINE2> a soul trapped in words 
when i try to write <LINE1> the words that i need to write <LINE2> they scatter like leaves 
just what i needed <LINE1> truth that filled a space within <LINE2> joy resultedthanks 
i love you i do <LINE1> but i am me you are you <LINE2> we will never be 
i am drunk as fuck <LINE1> sixteen beers and too much weed <LINE2> time to go to sleep 
minus forty five <LINE1> snowflakes fall in covfefe <LINE2> boiling with the frog 
communism won't work <LINE1> capitalism is evil <LINE2> our world is on fire 
many miles ahead <LINE1> pumping heart and pumping legs <LINE2> yet my mind is still 
i ate a melon <LINE1> i ate a watermelon <LINE2> watermelon time 
i was just looking <LINE1> for something you deemed profound <LINE2> in the wrong places 
are we not alone <LINE1> is no man an island <LINE2> we are all lonely 
an intruder here <LINE1>  marauding within my mind <LINE2> my peace is plundered 
make your bed with care <LINE1>  as you'll lie in it later <LINE2>  monsters fear routine 
another dull bar <LINE1> soda water still fizzing <LINE2> vapidly nodding 
the warm passing wind <LINE1>  brought life to the lone fruit fly <LINE2>  in the spiders web 
today too i <LINE1> go through my daily chores always <LINE2> running towards you 
how's about you hand <LINE1>  me a couple of 'em say <LINE2>  coupl'a them ibupoppin 
blackbird sing your song <LINE1> signal the dawn of the day <LINE2> a smile on my face 
i detest this mask <LINE1> covid is wearing me down <LINE2>  please make it end 
shackles of solitude <LINE1> suppressing creativity <LINE2> finally broken 
once a man named jack <LINE1> filtered smooth and charcoaled sweet <LINE2> stole my righteous soul 
how could she have died <LINE1> she was so beautiful <LINE2> golden blushing bride 
a thin pane of glass <LINE1> protects me from icy winds <LINE2> who is more fragile 
not every line with <LINE1> five seven five formation <LINE2> counts as a haiku 
winter is coming <LINE1> snowflakes start to fall form sky <LINE2> they land on freezed earth 
march on drummer boy <LINE1> what else is there you can do <LINE2> their ghosts cheer for you 
another problem <LINE1> new challenge to overcome <LINE2> focus move forward 
putting slashes in <LINE1> a random sentence does not <LINE2> make it a haiku 
man i hate haikus <LINE1> that don't have five seven five <LINE2> translates get passes 
to change entirely <LINE1> complete metamorphosis <LINE2> mind body and soul 
one thing overcome <LINE1> along comes another one <LINE2> will not defeat me 
nighttime falls on earth <LINE1>  it is time to go to bed <LINE2> my tea it went cold 
waves crashing on sand <LINE1> cold winds bite my very soul <LINE2> my mind grows weak and tired 
boobs i like your boobs <LINE1> they cute nice the perfect size <LINE2> a handful of joy 
these somber spirits <LINE1> in the trees the rocks the air <LINE2> ancestors surround 
locked in memory <LINE1> so bright innocent were you <LINE2> hear my prayer lord 
existential dread <LINE1> death is approaching always <LINE2> twink called me daddy 
old ways leading me <LINE1> stop pray choose the better way <LINE2> love the way this day 
the sea has no plug <LINE1>  sight is fogged and land astray <LINE2>  for that is your life 
with conformity <LINE1> individualism dies <LINE2> in complete silence 
her eyes could start wars <LINE1> winds blow at her very whim <LINE2> and they say her name 
whisper quietly <LINE1>  or they may hear the secret <LINE2>  meant only for me 
on a frozen lake <LINE1> she sits and sings to the world <LINE2> melodies echo 
tortuous our journey <LINE1> distant shore awaits our arrival <LINE2> follow the son 
beauty before me <LINE1> beauty within you my joy <LINE2> beauty lights my day 
discourse i missed you <LINE1> ideas freely shared thank you <LINE2> back into silence 
a constant stalemate <LINE1> depression the ultimate <LINE2> game of lonely chess

telling her goodnight <LINE1> and that her card was perfect <LINE2> family hallmark 
summer's almost here <LINE1> birds flying north seems like it <LINE2> never went away 
steam rises off rice <LINE1> impatient i take a bite <LINE2> ouch should've waited 
reforging a sword <LINE1> like a nature coming back <LINE2> after our every war 
in another world <LINE1>  and with another lifetime <LINE2> i would still love her 
the sea meets the shore <LINE1> at exactly the place where <LINE2> the shore meets the sea 
the overhead sun <LINE1> enters my bedroom to find <LINE2> me asleep till noon 
i put on a mask <LINE1> nobody seemed to notice <LINE2> the mask still remains 
danger beside us <LINE1> slowly passing with caution <LINE2> shall i deal with it 
under vegas lights <LINE1> dreams are dreampt and fortunes lost <LINE2> under vegas plights 
heater on at night <LINE1>  air conditioner by day <LINE2>  springtime is fickle 
living life unseen <LINE1> i wish someone noticed me <LINE2> just for a moment 
indian fort trail <LINE1> i sit and wonder of those <LINE2> who came before me 
a glow far beyond the crest <LINE1> you beckon to go <LINE2> bathing in the basking light 
when i play music <LINE1>  only thing i hear <LINE2>  everyone groaning 
a brief connection <LINE1> with someone i've never met <LINE2> through these simple words 
words cheap in value <LINE1> deeds accomplishments treasured <LINE2> action versus talk 
loud music hot girls <LINE1> sleepless nights regrets and lust <LINE2> taste of sad endings 
you must want my hate <LINE1> lie after lie for a month <LINE2> love is forgiveness 
glowing horizon <LINE1> sun rises above the trees <LINE2> birds are elated 
oops forgive me please <LINE1> imperfect in many ways <LINE2> i trust in god's love 
my feet callusing <LINE1> over the concrete ablaze <LINE2> barefoot summer days 
on time to meeting <LINE1> important person missing <LINE2> let's discuss weather 
dancing pink flower <LINE1> through the blinds i broke when drunk <LINE2> maybe i'll be fine 
darkness falls quickly <LINE1> the sun sets behind mountains <LINE2> the air quickly cools 
normal is a vex <LINE1> both nothing and everything <LINE2> harmonic chaos 
snow capped peak of fire <LINE1> mirage on the horizon <LINE2> kilimanjaro 
much weakness showing <LINE1> mighty strength to move forward <LINE2> built from fortitude 
the river is high <LINE1> overflowing her banks <LINE2> wet muddy kisses 
kids on the high street <LINE1> gurning into black mirrors <LINE2> leaves dance in the wind 
our world is burning  <LINE1> what god would create  <LINE2> a monster like man 
this brittle sunshine <LINE1> that hides the approaching storm <LINE2> betrayer in light 
when we're apart <LINE1> when words won't be enough <LINE2> what do i do then

looking for a date <LINE1> here's my kik and instagram <LINE2> omg wrong sub 
pink buds of springtime <LINE1> promises of better days <LINE2> line my drive my heart 
childhood full of hope <LINE1> then the slow death of the soul <LINE2> the wealthy need more 
a knife of words cut <LINE1> eyes full of anger crying <LINE2> tears streak the bare flesh 
don't be so sorry <LINE1>  no need to worry so much <LINE2> embrace your actions 
how can you trust me <LINE1> i will do my best this time <LINE2> i failed you again 
first test completed <LINE1> tomorrow my cousin weds <LINE2> it's a long way home 
cool splashing water <LINE1> rinses off bruised apricots <LINE2>  finally the sun 
too many niggers <LINE1> i don't have enough triggers <LINE2> to shoot them all with 
after working i <LINE1>  step outside to smoke a few <LINE2>  cigarettes exhale 
both real and taboo <LINE1> you and i trapped and yet free <LINE2> hidden behind screens 
in waters tainted <LINE1> oil and salt must resist the <LINE2> temptation to drink 
ships pass in the night <LINE1> on waters dark and frigid <LINE2> wakes never touching 
hollywood learning <LINE1> to read english subtitles <LINE2> is somehow progress 
did half the dishes <LINE1> wash your half when you have time <LINE2> we don't have servants 
i want to kiss you <LINE1> over and over again <LINE2> as if it's our last 
show me the face of <LINE1> one so bold yet so afraid <LINE2> and ask of them how 
running from despair <LINE1> forget about the lighter <LINE2> stop to the orgasm 
starlit summer sky <LINE1> soul searching for answers in <LINE2> sole strand of smoke 
the frogs were louder <LINE1> then the city was silent <LINE2> and we heard the wind 
snowdrops bloomed then died <LINE1> a late frost and they are gone <LINE2> one day of beauty 
asphyxiation <LINE1> onset claustrophobia <LINE2> solitude wishes 
the pattering rains <LINE1> the lights on the tree twinkle <LINE2> the season of warmth 
don't place your self worth <LINE1> on the almighty dollar <LINE2> place it on yourself 
on a desk a mouse <LINE1> manipulated by man <LINE2> as all of us are 
when did my life change <LINE1> it was the day i met you <LINE2> when you taught me love 
a lone fox looks up <LINE1> above a gondola swings <LINE2> the skiers are coming 
here i am falling <LINE1> into the failure that is <LINE2> my dull existence 
in tents or intense <LINE1> our intent is everything <LINE2> for love me or not 
boomers successful <LINE1> children get educated <LINE2> no home student debt 
winter is coming <LINE1> snowflakes start to fall from the sky <LINE2> they land on white snow 
after thirty years <LINE1> my hands numbed and scarred over <LINE2> have seen better days 
winter crescent moon <LINE1> chalice tipped by the goddess <LINE2> down comes crystal dew 
coronavirus <LINE1>  birds sing in squares undisturbed <LINE2>  i am the one caged 
in brazil we don't <LINE1> mind the metric in haikus <LINE2> as long as they're fun 
unknown and disguised <LINE1> what purpose does he stay here <LINE2> alone for a friend 
to drown my sorrows <LINE1> oh what a weird concept <LINE2> when it's me drowning 
the love i thought of <LINE1> the agony and despair <LINE2> hope is never lost 
my heart beats faster <LINE1> while getting dressed to go out <LINE2> thinking about you 
to be best of tao <LINE1>  give your self a way muon <LINE2>  more bubbles to pop 
sure could use a patch <LINE1> that would mend me and make you <LINE2> undesirable 
birds of paradise <LINE1>  violently shake in the storm <LINE2>  just like my heartstrings 
the river it turns <LINE1> fast and slow changes many <LINE2> the river of life 
lazy little bees <LINE1> venture out territories <LINE2> wilderness ahead 
fear joy love pain you <LINE1>  perfect distant beyond reach <LINE2>  warm peaceful asleep 
some six feet under <LINE1> i lay in eternal rest <LINE2> death is such a bore 
you're different to me <LINE1> hundred questions filled with wonder <LINE2> million questions filled with hate 
the world is over <LINE1> there is nothing left out there <LINE2> i must go on now 
let's do drugs and die <LINE1>  this life is not worth living <LINE2>  let's end it slowly 
waking up alone <LINE1> cigarettes smoked in silence <LINE2> a mourning dove coos 
i have twin cacti <LINE1>  their names are both steve and george <LINE2>  thanks for being there 
chewed lips part unsure <LINE1> feelings begging to escape <LINE2> no sound to be heard 
you deserve to smile <LINE1> what i don't know about you <LINE2> it never mattered 
this is a haiku <LINE1> sometimes they do not make sense <LINE2> illuminati 
use a strong rubber <LINE1> if you are in big trouble <LINE2> whilst drawing a duck 
patting a tiger <LINE1> it will roar loudly at you <LINE2> eat dinner instead 
silence broke itself <LINE1> under the weight of your words <LINE2> the echoes still ring 
there's rustling outside <LINE1>  chirps signal that all is well <LINE2> raccoons cross the lawn 
in the skies above <LINE1> hiding blue skies behind <LINE2> clouds never ending 
rhyme there is no rhyme <LINE1>  haiku and only haiku <LINE2>  prosed the small green sage 
thick cries through thin walls <LINE1> the longest day of the year <LINE2> the window is closed 
you careless young fool <LINE1> we can't undo this damage <LINE2> was it worthwhile 
gravestones in the fog <LINE1> river swells softly nearby <LINE2> when will it arrive 
wake me in the night <LINE1> so i may hear thine sweet voice <LINE2> the song i long for 
we cling to summer <LINE1> letting autumn go to waste <LINE2> memento mori 
my body vibrates <LINE1> when i look into your eyes <LINE2> pull me close to you 
i love you hate you <LINE1>  i know that you are leaving <LINE2>  please stay a while 
i spent yesterday <LINE1>  sipping coffee and writing <LINE2> terrible haiku 
the distant spring moon <LINE1> lights the eyes of a field mouse <LINE2> and spreads an owls wings 
my cat is angry <LINE1>  we arn't under blankets yet <LINE2> going to bed now 
sent you a message <LINE1> unfortunate no reply <LINE2> tinder game is weak 
to wander the earth <LINE1> searching for what we all seek <LINE2> what is our purpose 
when washing dishes <LINE1> only be washing dishes <LINE2> this is mindfulness 
no muff is too tough <LINE1> want your pussy in my face <LINE2> dance in the bed sheets 
i find peace in noise <LINE1> looking at the sun still see <LINE2> i die from the moon 
she's gone already <LINE1>  it's only been four minutes <LINE2>  and i'm missing her 
wake up every day <LINE1> spent all alone with my thoughts <LINE2> i wish you were there 
my penis is small <LINE1> i always piss on my balls <LINE2> diaper is a must 
summer night cold sweat <LINE1> nuzzle deeper in my neck <LINE2> soft fitful dreamer 
dragons soaring high <LINE1> over under chacked <LINE2> imagine wagons 
thick hot southern air <LINE1> carrying a strange scent of <LINE2> black eucalyptus 
something like a dream <LINE1>  you here listening right now <LINE2>  my breath calls your name 
i will wear short sleeves <LINE1> on purpose so our arms touch <LINE2> while we are dancing 
seems a tad surreal <LINE1> three thousand apparently <LINE2> too good to be true 
i lack direction <LINE1> not nearly as determined <LINE2> as my cement shoes 
where water flows dark <LINE1> and crows drop dead from the sky <LINE2> i found a heart cold like mine 
obsidian heart <LINE1> i endure fractures follow <LINE2> hollow light seeps in 
ah bonjour tristesse <LINE1>  i am emotionally <LINE2> unavailable 
headache cough sneezing <LINE1> the human predicament <LINE2> trapped in my body 
australia burns <LINE1> smoke from bush fires turns sky red <LINE2> wait and hope for rain 
i just smoked a bowl <LINE1> my anxiety is gone <LINE2> blissfully relaxed 
hands shoot up and up <LINE1>  faster than a gun duel <LINE2> which student to choose 
i fantasize much <LINE1>  about stupid little things <LINE2>  like smacking my friends 
three birds again <LINE1>  the black coven <LINE2>  but others chirp 
chubby cats on rafts <LINE1> they float downstream back to back <LINE2> felines relax 
we said forever <LINE1>  though we knew it was a lie <LINE2>  my heart is broken 
glaring at me and <LINE1> stating no comment is a <LINE2> blank sheet of paper 
limitless as sky <LINE1> without beginning or end <LINE2> the mind of buddha 
turbulent life <LINE1> she lived but will she one day <LINE2> live as my wife 
good morning momma <LINE1> here's to your own special day <LINE2> you cooking breakfast 
venus mother of women <LINE1> locked in eternal sun gaze <LINE2> clouds raining acid 
born here you belong <LINE1> the earth gives us land for free <LINE2> so we can live free 
love is an echo <LINE1> of our desire to be loved <LINE2> whispered to the dark 
pride misleads diverts <LINE1> broken when i fail and fall <LINE2> lord i surrender 
entry level role <LINE1> min five years experience <LINE2> contract to hire 
with a wagging tail <LINE1> you parade across the yard <LINE2> treasured bone in mouth 
moon glistening on <LINE1>  the forests tress <LINE2>  the coyotes howl 
true trepidation <LINE1> fear like a tsunami sweeps <LINE2> what if this goes well 
in this shameful world <LINE1> a fine lad and a burger <LINE2> running on empty 
message to my child <LINE1> take your time and please have fun <LINE2> message to myself 
hate anger envy <LINE1> ugly human emotions <LINE2> not to we will try 
smiling in the sun <LINE1> my dog does not stress about <LINE2> the meaning of life 
gather round the sun <LINE1> so our sins can be undone <LINE2> our souls now scorched clean 
orange fuji slopes <LINE1> the disgraced samurai kneels <LINE2> sword agleam with blood 
everything good fades <LINE1> i'm anchored in this bad place <LINE2> i need to get out 
spinnakers blended <LINE1> to watercolor in their <LINE2> competitive heat 
lovefriendshiphighly valued concepts <LINE1> once those concepts are put to test <LINE2> they're nothing but thatconcepts 
the blue light special <LINE1> making reservations to <LINE2> be seated in court 
i reach out to you <LINE1> with calloused hands come with me <LINE2> and escape this world 
fly mutant bird fly <LINE1> spread your wings into the sky <LINE2> you look like two birds 
drowned in tears spring pours <LINE1> every drop falls rumbling <LINE2> waiting for sunshine 
thanks to a new house <LINE1> political game of chess <LINE2> trump is now in check 
gone is carelessness <LINE1> the days of worry now here <LINE2> what now why the fuck 
traps await guide me <LINE1> your light breaking through the fog <LINE2> love leading each step 
men that work the earth <LINE1> to a different thing submit <LINE2> to its human shell 
so sweet as ever <LINE1>  i wrote you this short letter <LINE2>  love you forever 
unyielding fury <LINE1> justifiable vengeance <LINE2> unseen enemy 
separate no longer <LINE1> atoms reach a consensus <LINE2> we must unionize 
no gods no masters <LINE1> no one to tell us we're wrong <LINE2> together we can 
gagged bound and exposed <LINE1>  paint the caves of the ancients <LINE2>  fifty shades of cream 
unconditional <LINE1> withholding what keeps me strong <LINE2> can't it be like before 
is this even a haiku <LINE1> or only a poem in my <LINE2> imagination 
how man mistakes fate <LINE1> for lack of choise or free will <LINE2> a wise man thinks twice 
overwhelming task <LINE1> where is it that i should start <LINE2> can't i just give up 
the purple flowers <LINE1> icy breaths of winter wind <LINE2> stir the withered leaves 
i liked her a lot <LINE1> walked her home after party <LINE2> last time i saw her 
stay my golden sun <LINE1> warmth joy drive vision life itself <LINE2> go the world needs you 
midnight flowers bloom <LINE1> upon the thundering sky <LINE2> a new year is born 
in their sunday best <LINE1> they go to church down the street <LINE2> from where they will rest 
there is social cold <LINE1> in the city without lights <LINE2> beer is firewood 
the air feels crispy <LINE1> there is a clean and cold breeze <LINE2> the trees slowly sway 
so i know this girl <LINE1> daughter of my very best <LINE2> lover to nothing 
warm compliments <LINE1>  bite back through the frosted air <LINE2>  heat heals an iced mind 
whimpering child <LINE1> always new reasons for tears <LINE2> my damaged ego 
walking on the moon <LINE1> earth rising in full glory <LINE2> the home of mankind 
the night sky will sing <LINE1> stars will dance to celebrate <LINE2> the return of love 
calm before the wind <LINE1> emotions storm within <LINE2> dry eyes without tears 
aphids referee <LINE1> while beetle and mantis lock <LINE2> on a rosebud mat 
fever dreams collide <LINE1> hallucinatory skies <LINE2> sickness is not kind 
i stood up for me <LINE1> i feel no guilt about it <LINE2> for once in my life 
let the rain fall slow <LINE1> wash free the day's ambition <LINE2> free your busy mind 
the quiet room stands still <LINE1> from the window i seek strength <LINE2> but it lies within 
lost in space and time <LINE1> i focus on the flower <LINE2> brought back down to earth 
spring leaves emerging <LINE1> gone by seasons forgotten <LINE2> brighter days begin 
friday night again <LINE1> time to turn to haikus for <LINE2> my weekend sadness 
poetry is art <LINE1> quarantine is a science <LINE2> my dog is my friend 
my heart a lightning <LINE1>  rod and your laughter a strike <LINE2>  oh i am smitten 
a rhyme in loud space <LINE1> is just the same as colors <LINE2> on a busy page 
the amazon truck <LINE1>  approaches slowly for me <LINE2> it rumbles past damn 
let your heart roam free <LINE1> or you'll take it to the grave <LINE2> and it dies with you 
a journey began <LINE1> now the end is in my sight <LINE2> led by love and grace 
been feeling alone <LINE1> well here we are together <LINE2> need you here with me 
your words drip like ink <LINE1> staining us permanently <LINE2>  faded blurred and smudged 
i've found the reason <LINE1> a warm crippling sensation <LINE2> why cant i keep you 
tiny spark ignites <LINE1> flame grows burns swells with no release <LINE2> misery within 
caterpillars are <LINE1>  walking on the moon to see <LINE2>  me in the shower 
groggy mists submerge <LINE1> a break for the open air <LINE2> and light's path repaved 
dry eyes close with tears <LINE1> summer showers show the way <LINE2> grief bends the breaking 
just a pale blue dot <LINE1> the vicissitudes within <LINE2> pray towards what end 
silence takes music <LINE1> from noise as does death take life <LINE2> from our existence 
the moon is in view <LINE1> illuminating the night <LINE2> i can't fall asleep 
light beams through the hall <LINE1> dog pants hoping to answer <LINE2> the call of nature 
you can't run away <LINE1> someday it will destroy you <LINE2> the weight of your sins 
light has frequencies <LINE1> what determines its color <LINE2> not so black and white 
i hope the world ends <LINE1> the very moment he leaves <LINE2> so you die alone 
such foul disbelief <LINE1> the misery never relieves <LINE2> lamb seeks for penance 
port control peepers <LINE1> terminal nudity and <LINE2> no fig leaf for shame 
maddie is our cat  <LINE1> meow purr sleep eat poo and puke  <LINE2> just mostly cat things 
my disappointment <LINE1> is immeasurable and <LINE2> my day is ruined 
i get low to write <LINE1> dark thoughts churn into haikus <LINE2> have to get up soon 
i get an upvote <LINE1> on every post <LINE2> before it is viewed 
twilight admission <LINE1> for the acappella in <LINE2> a cricket concert 
feeling helpless now <LINE1>  tiny fragile seeds of fall <LINE2>  summer brings sweet fruit 
i just have to know <LINE1>  were you ever truly mine <LINE2> i don't think you were 
consistent pursuit <LINE1> relentless attempts to win <LINE2> fruition is near 
spring nightly wake up <LINE1> rattle of a stretched farting <LINE2> cuts silence of dark 
thrills amount to naught <LINE1> spiralling repetition <LINE2> it's time to wake up 
perfect are your words <LINE1> constantly given to me <LINE2> i hear and believe 
black and white restless <LINE1> thoughts storm mental horizon <LINE2> truth's deluge drowns heart 
lost my soprano <LINE1>  younger woman look at me <LINE2>  closer to the grave 
old wizard ponders <LINE1> magic cipher interupt <LINE2> spells cast long shadows 
the sun hidden there <LINE1> awaiting the next chapter <LINE2> time to shine my friend 
words are mere shovels <LINE1> dig in the rubble for graves <LINE2> or for survivors 
fearful men sprout wings <LINE1> but hero and coward fly <LINE2> different directions 
would you like me to <LINE1> remove your food from your fridge <LINE2>  or let it untouched

mandalorian  <LINE1> baby yoda is so cute  <LINE2> thanks jon favereau 
far away in bold <LINE1> desire quenching thirst in spring <LINE2> reckless autumn comes 
shut up mama gump <LINE1>  it's more like tv channels <LINE2>  not chocolate boxes 
the cold wind blows hard <LINE1>  against a weak little plant <LINE2>  uprooting it all 
let the vengeful sky <LINE1> loose silver arrows of rain <LINE2> on my umbrella 
cold covered in snow <LINE1> my heart slows for a moment <LINE2> until i see you 
dry leaves descending <LINE1> settling gently on the earth <LINE2> crumbling into dust 
don't worry you'll say <LINE1> that is how it always ends <LINE2> like i know it will 
tattered plastic bag <LINE1> ribboned across barbed wire <LINE2> anger carves up skin 
poured my heart onto a page <LINE1> an ocean of thought <LINE2> two droplets deep it drowned 
a botched waste of time <LINE1> days sink like stones in water <LINE2> muted clock hands wane 
another whiskey <LINE1> darkness calm cool soothing grip <LINE2> never waking up 
thousand miles apart <LINE1> two souls searched for a meaning <LINE2> they found each other 
feel empty in gut <LINE1> revolving days go away <LINE2> stuck in a deep rut 
hours drift downstream <LINE1>  i chase them daily but fall <LINE2>  into tommorow 
the groundhog had not <LINE1> seen his mischievous shadow <LINE2> why is it snowing 
often we have loved <LINE1> ever bound body spirit <LINE2> journey united 
the light flickers low <LINE1>  there is no night for these dreams <LINE2>  or bed to sleep in 
reforging a sword <LINE1> that comes back like a nature <LINE2> after every war 
a god shakes his head <LINE1> a child cries for his mother <LINE2> still just as empty 
the blackbird calls out <LINE1> his soft song gentle and sad <LINE2> he is calling her 
watercolor lights <LINE1> illume the sleeping city <LINE2> as whippoorwills mourn 
to kindergarten <LINE1> i googled the difference <LINE2> between duck and goose 
she is the night time <LINE1>  it is there no matter what <LINE2>  the moon makes me happy 
i love you so much <LINE1> that i would enjoy burning <LINE2>  just to be your light 
someone called the cops <LINE1> so they all got off the bus <LINE2> wonder what they did 
my heart overflows <LINE1> a babbling brook of sorrow <LINE2> though tears stream faster 
me myself and i <LINE1> what the fuck do i do now <LINE2> get a second job 
i am just a leaf <LINE1> and history a river <LINE2> carry me a while 
country boy dirt road <LINE1>  silhouetted trees dusk sky <LINE2>  sunset glows sunroof 
black hood on my head <LINE1> broken rules and soft crying <LINE2> death of the haiku 
talkin' 'bout big mike <LINE1> patrick ewing in a dress <LINE2> michelle obama 
loneliness is what <LINE1> you put in your coffee now <LINE2> to keep you going later 
we can only hope <LINE1> that a dark reddit ui <LINE2> will brighten the mood 
the shy pink blossom <LINE1> her colours show what could be <LINE2> lighthouse of beauty 
night skies are a bloom <LINE1> aurora borealis <LINE2> happiness above 
anger leading you <LINE1> prayer given up for you <LINE2> on my knees this day 
i carry around <LINE1> a box of melancholy <LINE2> it gets out sometimes 
imminent failure <LINE1> the world is spiraling down <LINE2> the same way i am 
what is there to lose <LINE1>  tell the ones you want to love <LINE2> or risk silence 
facts truths and wisdom <LINE1> soundbites headlines and boredom <LINE2> where is my compass 
together at last <LINE1> the earth no longer holds my soul <LINE2> as it once did yours 
i can't handle this <LINE1> take all of my broken tears <LINE2> my heart can't take this 
tremble at your touch <LINE1> this unbearable feeling  <LINE2> ecstatic release 
it's nearly five <LINE1> in need of her husband <LINE2> stricken by sickness 
past is history <LINE1> present is what we make of <LINE2> unwritten future 
brown curls wild and free <LINE1> he roars under the hot sun <LINE2> king of the playground 
buff buffalo buff <LINE1> buffalo buff buffalo <LINE2> buff buff buffalo 
i'm writing again <LINE1> after eight long years of doubt <LINE2> caused by a teacher 
surprised and challenged <LINE1> my plans interrupted now <LINE2> praying for wisdom 
murmur of the brook <LINE1> drowns out the sounds of highways <LINE2> once your feet get wet 
paralyzed my mind <LINE1> asked my brain yet heard my heart <LINE2> sucker for those eyes 
two amputations <LINE1> no insurance it cost me <LINE2> an arm and a leg 
heart filled singing <LINE1> filled my soul with love <LINE2> penetrated endured enjoyed 
yesterday revealed <LINE1> bones under my flowerbed <LINE2> today they have bloomed 
ungrateful spirits <LINE1>  rebel freely to their end <LINE2>  my lord please break me 
she meets him at night <LINE1> and he hikes up her plaid skirt <LINE2> fireflies dance til dawn 
hello mister cloud <LINE1> perhaps you are a missus <LINE2> please lend us some help 
at the wishing well <LINE1> yesterday you were crying <LINE2> and today you smile 
fame is a poison <LINE1> created by a demand <LINE2> to escape our lives 
even the soft breeze <LINE1>  brings invisible peril <LINE2>  when will we be safe 
a spark leads to fire <LINE1> leads to passion and desire <LINE2> forging trust and love 
after the drive in <LINE1> pouring rain they were stretching <LINE2> and segmented home 
astrological entity <LINE1> illuminating my night <LINE2> my beautiful moon 
dark and oppressive <LINE1> thunder echoing away <LINE2> lightning clouds no rain 
strange green oozing puss <LINE1> boy this haiku is sure gross <LINE2> good thing it's so short 
i took out the trash <LINE1>  and left the confines of home <LINE2>  an exciting day 
a slice and a cut <LINE1> a terrible self hatred <LINE2> washed away with tears

i guess i like you <LINE1> you can do wierd things to me <LINE2> i guess i dont care 
suicidal thoughts <LINE1> drown it all out with vodka <LINE2> swallow rinse repeat 
the mirror's not wrong <LINE1> white hair is mingling with black <LINE2> i blinked and got old 
cat smiling beguiling <LINE1> sleepy indolent and fat <LINE2> stretches for a scratch 
what is now to do <LINE1> no more sorrow to end it <LINE2> fleeting pain i am 
illumination <LINE1> bright speech of the brave and just <LINE2> read about in books 
taking up a space <LINE1> versus filling up a void <LINE2> a world of difference 
day and day and day <LINE1> flows away in silver streams <LINE2> moonbeams paint my way 
depression filled eyes <LINE1> forced smile to be polite <LINE2> on camera all night 
her eyes warm deep pools <LINE1> i'm fearing i'll drown in them <LINE2> a death worth dying 
eyeing his stomach <LINE1> i anticipated breaths <LINE2> but they never came 
the grim reaper shove <LINE1> unyielding with sirens and <LINE2> screaming through traffic 
you say those sad words <LINE1> now we are strangers again <LINE2> i steal a last kiss 
tired hands fumble  <LINE1> with the clasp of an old bra <LINE2> elm tree groans at night 
awake before dawn <LINE1> i hear the city rising <LINE2> the new day begins 
one thing is for sure <LINE1> epstein did not kill himself <LINE2> we have been lied to 
opened a seltzer <LINE1> feeling strong disappointment <LINE2> that it isn't beer 
lying in bed <LINE1> thor practicing carpentry <LINE2> the sound of rain 
wandering again <LINE1> in a world full of puppets <LINE2> who pulls on my strings

marilyn monroe <LINE1>  and john lennon too you know <LINE2>  were taken by foe 
these words i plucked straight <LINE1>  from the indian summer <LINE2> stirring in my breast 
cats and dogs are cool <LINE1> but so are spiders and snakes <LINE2> don't discriminate

snow ribbons dancing <LINE1> across frigid parking lot <LINE2> beauty of winter 
telling watchful eyes <LINE1> abundance of consciousness <LINE2> alone i laugh deep 
i haven't moved on <LINE1>  you are thread sewn through my heart <LINE2>  holding it in place 
apple sausage trees <LINE1> walk with toffee flavored roots <LINE2> after wakeful dreams

grievance good given <LINE1>  a higher posed hidden light <LINE2>  or a sense of space 
a forlorn switch of <LINE1> twilight in the cawing of <LINE2> daylight savings crows 
a disconnection <LINE1> a block of time that is gone <LINE2> will i ever know 
your words like daggers <LINE1> wielded with such precision <LINE2> invisible wounds 
bleeding though uncut <LINE1> internal wounds never healed <LINE2> now i love the pain 
rain water needed  <LINE1> but sometimes it ruins crops  <LINE2> the good somewhere stops

anthony bourdain <LINE1> ultimately lost the fight <LINE2> what chance do i have 
dastardly mud patch <LINE1> you took me on the way out <LINE2> i gave returning 
i should feel fainter <LINE1>  surely i've lost enough blood <LINE2>  this hole in my heart 
tell me your burden <LINE1>  i will toss mine to the ground <LINE2>  to help carry yours 
the wintry flecks were <LINE1> collected into heaps from <LINE2> their scissor snowflakes 
small blue bits gray clouds <LINE1> long lost dreams gone sand grains fall <LINE2> three more shots today 
just two waves joining <LINE1> crashing chaotic ocean <LINE2> then peaceful once more 
secluded alone <LINE1> humanities meaning lost <LINE2> i have become death 
we turn from the sun <LINE1> and the trees withdraw their sap <LINE2> small lives are ending 
open honest fresh <LINE1> love filled each moment with you <LINE2> again is my hope 
not today they said  <LINE1>  a difficult conversation  <LINE2>  nothing left to say 
stoic standing firm <LINE1> while seasons change around him <LINE2> the evergreen tree 
poor effort you say <LINE1>  the rules don't apply to me <LINE2>  the haiku rebel

i smoke weed daily <LINE1>  puff puff pass it is so dank <LINE2>  oh shit my pipe broke 
after three days off <LINE1>  back at work virtually <LINE2>  dressed from the waist up 
no wind for the sail <LINE1> all the world yet to be had <LINE2> birds have all the luck 
the daily drive home <LINE1> a scenic and gorgeous view <LINE2> lush valleys and hills 
the second hand is <LINE1>  the third hand the second hand <LINE2> is the minute hand 
but you'd be surprised <LINE1> the epiphanies you'd find <LINE2> in another's life 
i'm just waiting here <LINE1> you promised me forever <LINE2> now i am alone 
if the good die young <LINE1> then why am i still alive <LINE2> is it 'cause i'm bad 
here is a haiku <LINE1> that i wrote this afternoon <LINE2> about a haiku 
no clear path ahead <LINE1> take control with quarantine <LINE2> ensure your wellbeing 
friday to let loose <LINE1> saturday to recover <LINE2> sunday to repent 
remorseful angels <LINE1> a hummingbird the bottle <LINE2> on my knees softer 
gilding a goldfinch <LINE1> perched within a budding tree <LINE2> he unties her scarf 
never are things perfect <LINE1> imperfections like spring leaves <LINE2> love every day 
dreams are so vapid <LINE1> when both your eyes are closed <LINE2> all you see is me 
i wish i cared less <LINE1> i wish that i could forget  <LINE2> erase my sadness 
somewhere over the <LINE1> rainbow way up high there's a <LINE2> land that i heard of  
i come home and see <LINE1> house become menagerie <LINE2> five roommate monkies 
future approaching <LINE1> who to be what to seek out <LINE2> i only want peace 
a plane in the sky <LINE1> gone with nothing left behind <LINE2> is everyone lost 
the fight that broke us <LINE1> in bed we lay quietly <LINE2> her hand grabs for mine 
are you serious <LINE1> i'm not somebody you know <LINE2> obvious red flags 
huddle cuddle dance <LINE1> from my heart flows rhythm to <LINE2> symbiotic friends 
made for you am i <LINE1> in your presence ever joy <LINE2> ever praise and thanks 
bristlecones grow old <LINE1> waiting for one to do right <LINE2> someone anyone 
thoughts on death today <LINE1> teach me strength for tomorrow <LINE2> my time begins now 
desecration for <LINE1>  a sliver of bone fragment <LINE2>  to be weaponized 
grandiosity <LINE1> impressive verbosity <LINE2> mediocrity 
kneeling at the foot <LINE1> of god eating her pussy <LINE2> cumming on her toes nsfw 
winter in holland <LINE1> shivering trees undressing <LINE2> like modest schoolgirls 
grey january <LINE1> sentinel evergreens stand <LINE2> no wind to sway with 
moonlit nocturne dream <LINE1> sights and sounds of majesty <LINE2> mind of fantasy 
i drove to my hike <LINE1> anticipating nature <LINE2> sign said it was closed 
wisdom undefined <LINE1> street or book knowledge the same <LINE2> takes time to acquire 
the world is busy <LINE1> you tried to stop me today <LINE2> instead i rushed past 
my beloved sam <LINE1> constant loyal companion <LINE2> with googley eyes 
forest burns birthing ash <LINE1> that when accumulated <LINE2> is equal in mass 
i am writing this <LINE1> as i'm walking in the cold <LINE2> to go buy a drink 
rolling thunder booms <LINE1> the heavens refresh the earth <LINE2> again comes the sun 
a samhain candle <LINE1> hangs throughout the reflections <LINE2> fleetingly burning 
a new phone setup <LINE1> erased your contact info <LINE2> history deleted 
reaching for a hand <LINE1> my fingers catch only air <LINE2> i pull myself up 
glowing horizon <LINE1> sun emerges from the trees <LINE2> elation of birds 
tv addiction <LINE1> watching way too many shows <LINE2> must break this habit 
she's so dangerous <LINE1> just kidding she's quite boring <LINE2> predictable too 
husband's been watching <LINE1> too much ancient aliens <LINE2> we now wear tin foil 
branches sway gently <LINE1> her movements are small and brisk <LINE2> the fan purrs gently 
the whole world at stake <LINE1> every day every moment <LINE2> a typical love 
i've escaped i'm free <LINE1> ran from everything but <LINE2> i can't run from me 
a silent contest <LINE1> of public restroom strangers <LINE2> who scrubs hands longest 
at a wedding <LINE1> allah permits drinking wine <LINE2> a blessed sacrament 
you should realize <LINE1> that other people's progress <LINE2> is not your failure 
oak and hickory <LINE1> mighty spruce tower above <LINE2> oh appalachia 
lord hayagriva <LINE1> you now make your presence known <LINE2> your wisdom comes home 
the concorde featured <LINE1>  a droop snoot a droop snoot the snoot <LINE2>  would droop the snoop droopped 
pining for you <LINE1>  like pins and needles <LINE2>  on my fingertips 
you aphrodite <LINE1> that i have loved so tender <LINE2> let go this mortal 
delicious golden <LINE1> the quantity of apples <LINE2> the shallow waters 
existential pain <LINE1>  nihilistic dilemmas <LINE2>  a day in my life 
a cool gust of wind <LINE1>  kid running with untied shoes <LINE2>  i guess fall is near 
what must be done now <LINE1> to succeed later in life <LINE2> price of admission 
who was that first ape <LINE1> who looking at some strange thing <LINE2> made its noise like blake 
his scent made her want <LINE1> his scent made me comfortable <LINE2> his scent hurts the most 
the heart of the home <LINE1> for contemplating flat screens <LINE2> and mantle remotes 
i will quit this thing <LINE1> pour me beer instead of gin <LINE2> tomorrow perhaps 
deep connectedness <LINE1> a search lasting a lifetime <LINE2> you are not alone 
moored in a slip and <LINE1> anchored to a bed with the <LINE2> limp sheets for a sail 
a single buoy <LINE1> tilting in the ebb and flood <LINE2> aged with salted breeze 
tried to write haiku <LINE1> but can't think of one right now <LINE2> try again later 
drying tears leaving  <LINE1> tracks of salty sorrow and  <LINE2> empty winter nights 
advent has ended <LINE1> now to celebrate your love <LINE2> soul embraced with joy 
harsh sand slathered me <LINE1> coating my delicate core <LINE2> no more can it stay 
lily pad playgrounds <LINE1> amphibians hopscotching <LINE2> into croaked hors d'oeuvres 
a bird nests above <LINE1> it guards its young from all threats <LINE2> i hit my head hard 
memory of you <LINE1> your smell lingers on my coat <LINE2> illusions of you 
water washed me clean <LINE1> spirit filled my soul this day <LINE2> seventy years back 
carnations blossomed <LINE1> vibrant colors changed through time <LINE2> now wilting beauties 
no i'm not okay <LINE1>  i'm slowly dying each day <LINE2>  
pestilence resort <LINE1> mosquitoes are returning <LINE2> on buzzing jet skies 
chapter two begins <LINE1> all codes revealed by nature <LINE2> hints on each new moon 
a seed gets planted <LINE1> the bud explodes into color <LINE2> flower of rainbows 
my lonely shadow <LINE1> splatters a giant reflection <LINE2> and the room combusts 
the sea carved the stone <LINE1> polished smooth it has no cracks <LINE2> but no other shape 
serendipity <LINE1> it just clicks and you know it <LINE2> the missing piece fits 
encased in static <LINE1> i struggle and beg to be <LINE2> functional again 
stared at your garden <LINE1>  through the window of your church <LINE2>  at your funeral 
when heart rattles cage <LINE1> it constricts its horizons <LINE2> never to be free 
ice crystals falling <LINE1> blanketing and sparkling <LINE2> snow makes me happy 
death knocks at my door <LINE1>  he is who he says he is <LINE2>  no light for proud men 
away from the beach <LINE1>  still lost in the blue ocean <LINE2>  such marvelous eyes 
first summer raindrops <LINE1> a tadpole stirs in the murk <LINE2> hope springs eternal 
few things left to do <LINE1> spring spent in isolation <LINE2> guess i'll write haiku 
mothers are a waste <LINE1>  alcoholic rage on me  <LINE2> finally find peace 
slavery is wrong <LINE1> according to westerners <LINE2> who fund slave labor 
diving for cover <LINE1> that machine gun mouth also <LINE2> set the dog to flee 
a dogs loud barking <LINE1> the bark of the forest trees <LINE2> one jarring one still 
it's great although tough <LINE1> i made it for you special <LINE2> it's made of your heart 
lightning spans the night <LINE1>  each a shard of light but in <LINE2>  tandem a phoenix 
i was shaken down <LINE1>  a dying used autumn leaf <LINE2>  trampled under feet 
brown red leaves of fall <LINE1> paint the trail awaiting sail <LINE2> aboard atumn's gale 
six in the evening <LINE1> my eyes yearning to meet his <LINE2> puppy love on screen 
a cold starless night <LINE1> solitude gives no solace <LINE2> when does the sun rise 
let me be honest <LINE1> i'm honestly here for this <LINE2> same from the get go 
the jury duty <LINE1> noticed my address for a <LINE2> democratic turn 
guess i made you up <LINE1> cautious pretender of love <LINE2> you never got it 
green blanket <LINE1> upon bashful earth <LINE2> twinkling sky 
eyes lock souls collide <LINE1>  passion becomes tangible <LINE2>  through you i am home 
looking up i cry <LINE1>  gazing back you embrace me <LINE2>  understanding love 
the quiet is good <LINE1> that's what my therapist says <LINE2> let's just enjoy it 
i wish you could see <LINE1>  all that you have done to me <LINE2>  i am dead inside 
i know that you woke <LINE1> to find a cold empty bed <LINE2> alone once again 
chairs turned to the south <LINE1> take a seat now run and jump <LINE2> dimples from laughter 
thunder and evening <LINE1> set in on a dark valley <LINE2> rainstorms then ensue 
formation foretold <LINE1> with mares' tail flicking the sky <LINE2> and swishing for rain 
back in my dorm room <LINE1> i left my dildo in the <LINE2> refrigerator 
ran out a week back <LINE1>  started using shower head <LINE2>  send toilet paper 
dairy cows are raped <LINE1> children torn from their mothers <LINE2> so you can eat cheese 
a baby bird drops <LINE1> abrupt winds of a past life <LINE2> empty skies ahead 
my days are numbered <LINE1> yet my life still feels empty <LINE2> just like this haiku 
my daughter chases <LINE1> a leaf refusing to land <LINE2> how far will you go 
regurgitated <LINE1> gastric acid and bile <LINE2> delicious cocktail 
the fast moving clouds <LINE1> rested below scorching sun <LINE2> to give me respite 
foul demons of hell <LINE1> said the brave man with gusto <LINE2> they did not stir once 
if you see someone <LINE1> who looks like they need a friend <LINE2> be that friend to them 
dreamed of a haiku <LINE1> in which was the word haiku <LINE2> can't remember it 
back in custody <LINE1> department of erections <LINE2> i love prison cock 
in her voice sorrow <LINE1> i wish i could help somehow <LINE2> distance restricts me 
a merry go round <LINE1> that horse is inanimate <LINE2> bobbing up and down 
mad at myself <LINE1> the ball keeps hitting <LINE2> its own shadow 
aggravated plus <LINE1> manipulative ranting <LINE2> blood pressure rising 
we said forever <LINE1> on the stairway to never <LINE2> lacking diligence 
this is my poem <LINE1> now it is nearly finished <LINE2> haiku very much 
the hairy creature <LINE1> with its dry craggy brown tongue <LINE2> seeks a water source 
the silent snow falls <LINE1> winter wraps a cold embrace <LINE2> spring promises life 
pale winter sunset <LINE1> drowning under soggy clouds <LINE2> fever soaks the bed 
this pitiless ice <LINE1>  breaks my ass like a tea cup <LINE2> every fucking year 
it took me too long <LINE1>  to notice i wrote haiku <LINE2>  for the wrong person 
upside down street sign <LINE1> dangling from a rusty bolt <LINE2> reflecting high beams 
the boy runs <LINE1> the girl studies <LINE2> death is upon us 
have a toke stick man <LINE1> empty my rack take a chance <LINE2> cold bones to the wind 
a flock of starlings <LINE1> in mindblowing formations <LINE2> birds can be awesome 
always in my mind <LINE1> i wrote about you today <LINE2> my love symphony 
the lonely ostrich <LINE1> sits atop yellow mountain <LINE2> and waits for ice cream 
the edge of the wedge <LINE1> the gilt on the things we have built <LINE2> how sound is the ground 
got into trouble <LINE1> somehow made it out alive <LINE2> rebels never die 
fields of red poppies <LINE1> lives cut down and strewn around <LINE2> lest we forget them 
octavio paz <LINE1>  i silently start to read <LINE2>  my soul seeks some peace 
to say i like you <LINE1>  discourse so complicated <LINE2>  humans interact 
when the water swims <LINE1> up the river towards source <LINE2> the fish understands 
the roar of the falls <LINE1> and time spent falling asleep <LINE2> what it takes to jump 
summer's almost here <LINE1> robins fly north seems like it <LINE2> never went away 
i yearn to be brave <LINE1>  fear drowns me and takes over <LINE2>  breathe and try again 
the environment cries <LINE1>  overindustrialize <LINE2> oh what have we done 
peacefully i go <LINE1> drowned in a sea of faces <LINE2> lungs filled with small talk 
answer lost to time <LINE1> who allowed canines egress <LINE2> has a catchy tune 
if angels are real <LINE1> then demons too must be real <LINE2> living in my mind 
out of comfort zone <LINE1> trusting in your grace my lord <LINE2> praying for wisdom 
she's got work early <LINE1> and i get to sleep in late <LINE2> colder without her 
though we are not free <LINE1>  the never was land must be <LINE2>  not yet means believe 
should i clean my room <LINE1> it's not that dirty it can <LINE2> wait how old am i 
unfathomable <LINE1> her love is for her children <LINE2> gift of god indeed 
crossing open sea <LINE1> sailing with a strong night wind <LINE2> guided by the stars 
a man in his car <LINE1> complains about the traffic <LINE2> to which he belongs 
our thoughts and prayers <LINE1> then we will just go along <LINE2> like nothing happened 
i want to be good <LINE1>  for whatever that is worth <LINE2>  i love everyone 
perfectly colored <LINE1>  manicured nails blue and red <LINE2> dressed for the party 
good taste in humor <LINE1> something i need to learn still <LINE2> my jokes are selfish 
a truth like water <LINE1> flows through cracks in your story <LINE2> discovers its shape 
roses from the grove <LINE1> in the kitchen they wait for <LINE2> the breeze the silence 
endless asphalt grows <LINE1> dissociate dissolve <LINE2> no destination 
haikus are easy <LINE1> writing them sensibly is <LINE2> very hard colander 
i change my colors <LINE1> just like a chameleon <LINE2> always unhappy

you jumping on me <LINE1> covered in pink polka dots <LINE2> no reason but love 
don't know what it means <LINE1> to be a human being <LINE2> i know what it's like 
knuckles turn pale white <LINE1> as i lean over the edge <LINE2> i slip then regret 
sitting here i be <LINE1> writing this haiku for you <LINE2> hoping for some praise 
fresh morning air <LINE1> warm bread and hot tea <LINE2> feeling cozy inside 
hitler as you know <LINE1> came from a whole family <LINE2> who used to hitle 
always you lead me <LINE1> my footprint in your imprint <LINE2> with each step there's love 
do you remember <LINE1> i know i am late to this <LINE2> love changes the mind 
having hit submit <LINE1>  your anonymous applause <LINE2>  the author awaits 
the morning birdsongs <LINE1> a delightful melody <LINE2> music to my ears 
nazis on the run <LINE1>  they live in argentina <LINE2>  let's leave them alone 
my penis fell off <LINE1> so my hot glue gun fixed it <LINE2> now i am crippled 
im a courier  <LINE1> i help santa at christmas  <LINE2> never once said thanks 
the avante garde nature <LINE1> of a fresh four lined haiku <LINE2> they might be the future 
i had to tell him <LINE1> a secret i was hiding <LINE2> he was not my son 
then there was your smile <LINE1> then my life changed forever <LINE2> then my soul sangthanks 
men and honesty <LINE1> although not complete strangers <LINE2> can pass each other 
autumn winds blow hard <LINE1> loud rain announces spring <LINE2> winter snow is mute 
times passes the leaves fall <LINE1> but the world stands still <LINE2> waiting for a cure 
old age pads your mind <LINE1> like fat and bad memories <LINE2> hard to get rid of 
is that all you have <LINE1> a blackberry lemonade <LINE2> a tart empty life 
change begins right now <LINE1> let music and dance commence <LINE2> coordination 
these wonderful things <LINE1> are misery within to <LINE2> those who possess them 
since mum passed away <LINE1> my whole world is upside down <LINE2> where are the clean clothes 
cool mornings embrace <LINE1> sparkling dew in the sunlight <LINE2> thoughts of you linger 
there're traces of you <LINE1> across all sensory domains <LINE2> fused in every spring 
awaiting sadness <LINE1> my love seeks another yet <LINE2> the ocean is calm 
invisible bricks <LINE1> construct imaginary <LINE2> blockades with purpose 
suddenly i smile <LINE1> as we stare at the sunrise <LINE2> because i met you 
have i known of you <LINE1> your beaten brow i have once kissed <LINE2> i soften for you 
fluorescent flickers <LINE1> bare feet cold on the roadway <LINE2>  empty headed fool 
friends since we were kids <LINE1> we don't have to put masks on <LINE2> we can be ourselves 
so it's my cake day <LINE1> it shouldn't be a surprise <LINE2> it comes every year 
chrysanthemum bod <LINE1> accepting all of the bees <LINE2> how indecent you 
i find this girl cool <LINE1> texting her is like a dream <LINE2>  i kinda love her 
after every drink <LINE1> she took another dosage <LINE2> of her medicine 
look at the sun's face <LINE1> tell me that joy wasn't born <LINE2> in the dark of space 
new moon darkling black  <LINE1> silent shadow sucking scar <LINE2> shining claw come back 
a pair of jade spheres <LINE1> brilliant in their dullness <LINE2> blink and i am lost 
im in love with you <LINE1> i carry on like im not <LINE2> im hurting myself 
bass line walks and talks <LINE1> with my headphones on i smile <LINE2>  listening to jazz 
you are more than just <LINE1> those arbitrary labels <LINE2> that you hide behind 
long branches before <LINE1> becoming a messy knot <LINE2> unfurled to the sea 
the bloated green leaf <LINE1> shudders in the utmost fear <LINE2> of cold northern winds 
camping in autumn <LINE1> awakened by falling leaves <LINE2> landing on my face 
on the porch one night <LINE1> i helped him to cry by just <LINE2> silently rocking 
crowd of witnesses <LINE1> so we areservants also <LINE2> filled with hope and joy 
the sun keeps rising <LINE1> to teach us the meaning of <LINE2> road slush and red lights 
nothing left to say <LINE1> everything out in the open <LINE2> bared for all to see 
how to milk almonds <LINE1> step one gather all your nuts <LINE2> step two buy real milk 
time will keep ticking <LINE1> and you will get older <LINE2> but always be young 
ambulance siren <LINE1> for whom does it hurry now <LINE2> it hurries for me 
somebody saved me <LINE1> from myself i go through life <LINE2> with my eyes wide shut 
cold lifeless sleep ends <LINE1> animals slowly emerge <LINE2> earth reawakens 
how unnatural <LINE1> are all the crowded places  <LINE2> with no one around 
poetry my art <LINE1> can't draw nor paint sing or dance <LINE2>  words are all i have 
this generation <LINE1> fingers in bad bad places <LINE2> electronica 
dancing in the wind <LINE1> thin and fragile in the end <LINE2> go begin again 
drawing herself close <LINE1> his shoulders tense on the seat <LINE2> they are not lovers 
days eating creamed corn <LINE1> nights spent studying your face <LINE2> our education 
home in a vowel <LINE1> and a scrubby consonant <LINE2> spelling out sparrows 
autumn winds blow hard <LINE1> loud rain announces each spring <LINE2> winter snow falls mute 
night fades with first light <LINE1> sun's returning it's all right <LINE2> time for a haiku 
still in the present <LINE1> moving toward the future <LINE2> rewinding the past 
terrified of this <LINE1> demon that keeps haunting me <LINE2> you will not best me 
hot ashes drift down <LINE1> blanketing the earth with snow <LINE2> for our last winter 
giving to strangers <LINE1>  spreads faith in humanity <LINE2> you are loved my friend 
share in happiness <LINE1>  it's the good times that will stick <LINE2>  get over yourself 
jade green navy blue <LINE1> we wait alone together <LINE2> a sunrise from you 
forever itching <LINE1> the river swirls and stretches <LINE2> begging for a scratch 
turning into dust <LINE1> with the moon under my feet <LINE2> i'm getting older 
the forsaken day <LINE1> many raiders assemble <LINE2> run like naruto 
i cut off his hand <LINE1> pleading i reveal the truth <LINE2> i am your father 
waiting for the stick <LINE1> the one they jam up your nose <LINE2> covid testing woes 
eating by myself <LINE1> i'm not as good as porn <LINE2> another drink please 
water in the hand <LINE1> happiness is ephemeral <LINE2> a kiss from the wind 
leftovers of your <LINE1> existence scattered round the <LINE2> apartment we shared 
the nighttime thunder <LINE1> frightens animals and birds <LINE2> my peaceful slumber 
like kissing stardust <LINE1> i become engulfed by you <LINE2> swallowing me whole 
autumn leaves falling <LINE1>  barren trees under grey clouds <LINE2>  empty until spring 
inspired by you <LINE1> i prepare to teach and share <LINE2> thank you lord jesus 
a bright shooting star <LINE1> you flew through my bleak dark life <LINE2> i miss your warm glow 
my own reflection <LINE1> fades away into the glass <LINE2> with each sip i take 
there's a wasp in here <LINE1> leave and i will let you live <LINE2> please do not sting me 
my heart beats for her <LINE1> the one who can give me life <LINE2> the one who takes it 
the pain stays hidden <LINE1> so they might live their lives right <LINE2> i gladly suffer 
oak rooted alone <LINE1>  but just over the hillside <LINE2>  lie an entire grove 
the globe is changing <LINE1> an end to modernity <LINE2> our bones will stand watch 
whoosh brisk wind blows cold <LINE1> cuts to the core bundle up <LINE2> cocoa brings warmth 
pale afternoon sky <LINE1> a breeze invites trees to dance <LINE2> wind chimes sing along 
sweet unscented toll <LINE1> forgive the bright firelight <LINE2> so bright we may burn 
pain in your body <LINE1>  disappointment in your soul <LINE2>  beauty still within 
voice sweet like honey <LINE1>  fluttering heart when eyes laid <LINE2>  you are my one wish 
the heavens shine down <LINE1> constellations drawn by man <LINE2> stories to be told 
of the stages five <LINE1> denial is the most fun <LINE2> ignorance is bliss 
the false friends stalk you <LINE1> the snakes constantly deceive <LINE2> crush them underfoot 
aimless wanderer <LINE1> a soul without home or kin <LINE2> an unwanted stray 
her laugh breaks the night <LINE1> fills the air with ancient sounds <LINE2> a dark opera 
watercolored skies <LINE1> reflect off the stepping stones <LINE2> lighting the cats face 
i breathe a small cloud <LINE1> in space it hangs keeping shape <LINE2> no breeze to stir it 
wonderfully made <LINE1> god's image likeness are we <LINE2> love is our purpose 
spent the day outside <LINE1> wasted the watercolor <LINE2> suppose i'll need more 
they say that when you die <LINE1> you go up into the sky <LINE2> but i'm afraid of heights 
sky spouts of water <LINE1>  from which cloud villages drink <LINE2> to quench their dry throats 
refrigerator <LINE1> refrigerator again <LINE2> refrigerator 
in our darkest hour <LINE1> seeking brightest light will act <LINE2> as beacon of hope 
the kaiju appears <LINE1> behold humanity's end <LINE2> king of the monsters 
you won't hold me now <LINE1> yet still my clipped wings will hurt <LINE2> must you hold me down 
my problem with drugs <LINE1>  i love to take them <LINE2>  i hate to stop 
all of life's lessons <LINE1> begin with a single step <LINE2> into the unknown 
ecstacy at work <LINE1> makes it hard to concentrate <LINE2> but my desk feels cool 
writing worth reading <LINE1> pouring ink onto pages <LINE2> a life worth living 
big larry he tall <LINE1> got big hands with them bit nails <LINE2> choke you hard be dead 
heavenly fragrance <LINE1> drifts through mild breeze what is it <LINE2> ah hyacinth blooms 
i long for it so <LINE1> your touch and delicate taste <LINE2> yet you pull away 
it wastes my time when <LINE1> problem exists between chair <LINE2> and keyboard leave me 
chickens counting eggs <LINE1> the days race by in circuits <LINE2> born again and blessed 
in my sleep i dream <LINE1> dreams of life scenarios <LINE2> imperturbable 
an orange sky rose <LINE1> deep purple and quiet blue <LINE2> fade away for day 
breath taken away <LINE1> heart now seems to be racing <LINE2> can't believe my eyes 
so many projects <LINE1> filling my day blessed am i <LINE2> thanks for the help lord 
sparks in velvet dark <LINE1> beautiful enchanting bright <LINE2> memories of you 
an eagle flies free <LINE1> the king for a thousand years <LINE2> ride the sky child 
cars are passing by <LINE1> always eager to go back <LINE2> this road takes us home 
beyond meat burger <LINE1> small french fries and small iced tea <LINE2> beyond basic lunch

weather torrid waves <LINE1> swimming with mortality <LINE2> freedom stillness comes 
i'm losing myself <LINE1> alcohol makes me rethink <LINE2> what do i feel now 
i presumed them slow <LINE1> but over time i have learned <LINE2> we walk unlike paths 
each moment surprise <LINE1> time slips by and you fill it <LINE2> perfect is your love 
innocence tainted <LINE1> alone in the tomb of thought <LINE2> preoccupation 
a blooming field <LINE1> brimming with colours with life <LINE2> battle once raged here 
i get knocked down but <LINE1> i get up again never <LINE2> gonna keep me down 
alone in my mind <LINE1> my thoughts my thoughts my thoughts sh oot <LINE2> my mind needs be shut 
and then it hit me <LINE1> awful is the best there is <LINE2> also a bullet 
bright sparks everywhere <LINE1> kindled passion for burning <LINE2> ablaze so vibrant 
a founding father <LINE1> invented the lightning rod <LINE2> and bifocals too 
she left on our vows <LINE1> our wedding has been postponed <LINE2> indefinitely 
you ended your life <LINE1>  i never even met you <LINE2>  now i deal with it 
needle to the groove <LINE1>  wheel of time keeps on spinning <LINE2>  song of life sings on 
a yearly review <LINE1> wtf was i doing <LINE2> living a nightmare 
a lonely petal <LINE1> fluttering through the city <LINE2> coloring the sky 
adulthood engaged <LINE1> childhood receded quickly <LINE2> such was a tough time 
over a light fire <LINE1> i dry my cheek of white tears <LINE2> losing part of you 
don't fucking text her <LINE1>  i mean it do not text her <LINE2>  fuck i texted her 
you will never know <LINE1> the depth and breadth of the mark <LINE2> you leave behind you 
bounded by myself <LINE1> been in prison for too long <LINE2> what to do once free 
to do or not to <LINE1> to be or to not to be <LINE2> that is the question 
outside sickness spreads <LINE1>  you in your home me in mine <LINE2>  we connect through screens 
big buck is my name <LINE1>  and deer hunter is my game <LINE2>  lend me a quarter 
control comes within <LINE1> restrain the raging malice <LINE2> of young year's yearnings 
sometimes i daydream <LINE1> of the man i thought i'd be <LINE2> it's very foolish 
some crow's mistake <LINE1> in the backyard <LINE2> a small silver frog appears 
anger raging fire <LINE1> stoked by feelings unresolved <LINE2> burns all in its wake 
i retained a dream <LINE1> many years of forgetting <LINE2> hope for a replay 
such perfect weather <LINE1> thank you lord for this moment <LINE2> a glimpse of heaven 
you're out protesting <LINE1> over paint and your dark roots <LINE2> count me out of it 
locked up and retained <LINE1> a treasure long forgotten <LINE2>  i hope to be freed 
she danced like water <LINE1> clear wild and timeless weaving <LINE2> through the rugged earth 
coronavirus <LINE1>  nature's callous mighty yawn <LINE2>  i must shave today 
desert sun shower <LINE1> droplets of rain dust glint from <LINE2> mountain mahogany 
so why call my name <LINE1>  when i was the happiest <LINE2> loner of us all 
we too would see far <LINE1> if on giants' shoulders stood <LINE2> but we bear their soles 
our time together <LINE1> while it ended horribly <LINE2> miss you everyday 
no haikus exist <LINE1>  about tiger king till now <LINE2>  this had to be fixed 
eyes gaze up at me <LINE1> his fingers about my hair <LINE2> so we are in dreams 
cacoon split apart <LINE1> complete metamorphosis <LINE2> butterfly takes flight 
a year full of change <LINE1> the good the bad the ugly <LINE2> two thousand twenty 
dandelion clocks <LINE1> faded tattoos and sweet tea <LINE2> i still remember 
the cardinals are here <LINE1> groundhog shadow <LINE2> or not 
multiverse sooths me <LINE1> always better always worse <LINE2> gives me perspective 
haunted moon thoughtless <LINE1> a roiling stream snowflakes fall <LINE2> continues never 
familiar words <LINE1> unaware it chatters by <LINE2> a secret message 
push ups sit ups squats <LINE1> no machines no weights no friends <LINE2>  just isolation 
a corpse on the floor <LINE1> self inflicted bullet wound <LINE2> this is a protest 
green leaf in the sun  <LINE1> the bumblebee buzzes in <LINE2>  six legs feel the rest 
pushing not working <LINE1> tugged a certain direction <LINE2> pulled to destiny 
a small fishing boat <LINE1> sways and swerves on the grim song <LINE2> of father ocean 
losses unending <LINE1>  homesick without knowledge <LINE2>  can home be found yet 
brushing ash off bone <LINE1> half men crawl though bitter fields <LINE2> glory be the light 
today is monday <LINE1> i will be counting numbers <LINE2> the same on tuesday 
i miss my best friend <LINE1> need to hear your voice again <LINE2> give my life for yours 
my birth was abrupt <LINE1> even at sea snow will fall <LINE2> if the time is ripe 
mind stuck in the clouds <LINE1>  shy and lonely as i breathe <LINE2>  heart cold as first snow 
the dark closes in <LINE1>  enveloping the world in <LINE2>  a blanket of peace 
searching in the dark <LINE1> yearning for lost connections <LINE2> my lonely bluetooth 
i thought it was grass <LINE1>  but today ah white flowers <LINE2>  what else need i know 
all i love will die <LINE1> i will become old and poor <LINE2> and then i'll be gone 
i've lied to myself <LINE1>  so i make this pledge to truth <LINE2>  later begins now 
such magnanimous talent <LINE1> stifled by dogma <LINE2> imposed to enable 
a country so small <LINE1> full of beauty and wonder <LINE2> i am in heaven 
if i know nothing <LINE1>  but perhaps nothing make sense <LINE2>  so i know the sense 
a shell of blankets <LINE1> keep me warm in the autumn <LINE2> another cold day 
a sole rubber ball <LINE1> bouncing through the bright meadow <LINE2> a boing a smile 
chilled winds of winter <LINE1> red leaf blown through air then stops <LINE2> an entire life 
the rape of nanking <LINE1>  not a subject you see much <LINE2>  in this kind of poem 
no tinder no more <LINE1> no more loneliness in store <LINE2> no storms anymore 
how perfect your word <LINE1> you are the way truth and life <LINE2> lambwe follow you 
coffee at midnight <LINE1>  no wonder i'm lacking sleep <LINE2>  fill me with regret 
when i close my eyes <LINE1> i can pretend i'm with her <LINE2> the girl of my dreams 
oh little flower <LINE1> lift your head now open up <LINE2> time for you to bloom 
mosquitoes buzz near <LINE1> sticky red popsicle hands <LINE2> tasty summer treat 
on the first thursday <LINE1> of each month in the summer <LINE2> they have free concerts 
he wants a wall built <LINE1> purportedly for defense <LINE2> but that makes no sense 
yaah it's rewind time <LINE1> if i could control rewind <LINE2> i would want fortnite 
four folds and tidy <LINE1> stacking squares and filling up <LINE2> flush top unkempt hair 
cyber surrendings <LINE1> the pain is real <LINE2> artificial loneliness 
sickness in the air <LINE1> i have nowhere i can fly <LINE2> so please clip these wings 
no my good preacher <LINE1> i am not that desperate <LINE2> i believe in death 
could have would have all <LINE1> but no desire to persist <LINE2> outcome is nothing 
fallen leaves red brown <LINE1> mini tornadoes rise up <LINE2> chills face and warms soul 
mass <LINE1> shooting <LINE2> stars 
romantic ideas <LINE1> minimal words telling all <LINE2> lost in translation 
he walks through a field <LINE1> lighter than a butterfly <LINE2> and the world trembles 
anticipation <LINE1> we're alone on the night beach <LINE2> to realize this kiss 
my birthday is close <LINE1> thank you for being my mom <LINE2> i miss your meatloaf 
was there no sentence <LINE1> no words i could rearrange <LINE2> nothing to save you 
look a petal falls <LINE1> from the flowers you gave me <LINE2> as they slowly die 
bowing to power <LINE1> unconscious crowd of pretence <LINE2> how ridiculous 
tasteless spaghetti <LINE1> is it olive garden or <LINE2> coronavirus 
i am filled with rage <LINE1>  everything is maddening <LINE2>  i cannot go on 
clouds in autumn skies <LINE1> drift like my sense of purpose <LINE2> i am fucking bored 
don't pick up that bag <LINE1> it's contents won'tregister <LINE2> until it's picked up 
i have to tell you <LINE1> a secret unknown to man <LINE2> i still do love you

stardust formations <LINE1> from infinite directions <LINE2> view centers briefly 
summertime dreaming <LINE1> remembercelebrate now <LINE2> a taste of heaven 
cherry blossoms dance <LINE1> a fleeting touch and sparks <LINE2> fuelled by inner strength 
funny how we crossed paths <LINE1> the second i stopped searching <LINE2> finally at home 
the you that you lit <LINE1> illuminated my world <LINE2> if only briefly 
falling quickly down <LINE1> holds an unquestionable <LINE2> submerging comfort 
the weeping roses <LINE1> conceal their beauty from light <LINE2> not six feet apart 
mother earth is <LINE1> just showing off how great <LINE2>  she is without us 
watermelon seeds <LINE1> become childhood projectiles <LINE2> produced from produce 
together again <LINE1>  i swore i heard you saying <LINE2> the alarm bell rings 
twenty seventeen <LINE1> sexual harassment meet <LINE2> karma enough said 
i did not know then <LINE1> this ugly wrapping paper <LINE2> would last for ten years 
amber horizon <LINE1>  the lone swallow carves her path <LINE2>  refusing to fail 
self healing takes time <LINE1> learning and unlearning roles <LINE2> much needed retreat 
pop the molly yes <LINE1>  heart beats inside of my chest <LINE2>  this feeling the best 
i awoke alive <LINE1> yet absorbed with tiny things <LINE2> wrens chirp in winter 
rapid volley now <LINE1> worthy adversary found <LINE2>  ball swift as the wind 
travelling homewards <LINE1> my being could not refuse <LINE2> the pavement's embrace 
pick up the pieces <LINE1> put the puzzle together <LINE2> i am incomplete 
wool over closed eyes <LINE1> take off the sweaty blind fold <LINE2> i'm still not looking 
learning asl <LINE1> deaf client in my office <LINE2> understands my signs 
warmth and sunlight <LINE1> dark clouds slowly encroaching <LINE2>  now i am ready

stork on old snag isle <LINE1> snaps at the nearest ripple <LINE2>  falls in epic fail 
if we could just fly <LINE1> like the birds above our heads <LINE2> we could get you home 
dark clouds in the sky <LINE1> struggles and hardships await <LINE2> till the light breaks through 
beloved festive <LINE1> tree of joy cut down by saw <LINE2> yet celebrates life 
abrupt self loathing <LINE1> reflecting stupidity <LINE2> reflect self esteem 
twelve o'six am <LINE1> words scatter and escape me <LINE2> fugitive letters 
a shallow cover <LINE1> afforded time to sink in <LINE2> new found loyalty 
with you by my side <LINE1> below the sakura tree <LINE2> our minds wander off 
it was my fault <LINE1> i should have told them the truth <LINE2> i almost killed you

her eyes are not fooled <LINE1> they see beyond webs of lies <LINE2> the truth in season 
trap house shots ring out <LINE1> sirens swarm down on the streets <LINE2> the junkie dreams divine 
her tiny fingers <LINE1> whose touch evokes my true soul <LINE2> i'm finally home 
my ume plum tree <LINE1> plundered by wildlife and wind <LINE2> no harvest this year 
something powerful <LINE1> is rising up inside me <LINE2> do i let it out 
i would like to change <LINE1> into something beautiful <LINE2> powerful and free 
blanched pregnant sky <LINE1> delivers morning thunder <LINE2> gutters swell with leaves 
has our short spring past <LINE1>  frost on the rose <LINE2>  yet the birds sing for me 
at sunrise tears fall <LINE1> vicissitudes yet unhealed <LINE2> in time grow as love 
like a metaphor <LINE1> similes are an ocean <LINE2> meaning drowns if deep 
all you had to do <LINE1> was take a look in my eyes <LINE2> i'll tell you the truth 
on the building's roof <LINE1> rain floats down through the still night <LINE2> time slows with each drop

the finch looks harried <LINE1> head jutting twice per second <LINE2> it's like chill out dude 
the old fisherman <LINE1> he sits on the bay all alone <LINE2> a drop in the sea

a huga smilejoy <LINE1> child you touched and warmed my heart <LINE2> thank you lord for that 
neighbours so happy <LINE1> me alone and so depressed <LINE2> hot tears streaming down 
a fallen leaf <LINE1> crunched into shards <LINE2> the sweeping wind 
the love she gave me <LINE1> how safe she would make me feel <LINE2> how could i forget

porcelain soft skin <LINE1> a tear on your cool cheek <LINE2> i love you unknown 
there is more to life <LINE1> i just haven't found it yet <LINE2> i will keep searching 
earth worm on pavement <LINE1> lost in a cold heartless world <LINE2> who will intervene

evil can be good <LINE1>  when you use the right amount <LINE2>  world domination 
i'm deathly tired <LINE1> but i'll leave you this haiku <LINE2> with hopes you'll sleep too 
morning distractions <LINE1> afternoon boredom eating <LINE2> at night the flood comes 
morning sun has left <LINE1> promises from yesterday <LINE2> i opened my eyes 
birds perched on a branch <LINE1> swaying in the summer breeze <LINE2> fuck the fucking fuck 
can a mote of dust <LINE1> upon reaching sentience <LINE2> influence its course

the first thing i do <LINE1> after falling off the cliff <LINE2> up the stairs again 
you leaned into me <LINE1> as you laughed brushing my arm <LINE2> electricity 
this torrential rain <LINE1> beats down and drowns out the sound <LINE2> of the day's worries 
weather that i like <LINE1> joy for me stifling for you <LINE2> united in love 
blindfolded i leap for the stars <LINE1>  crash i have found <LINE2>  the ceiling 
take it slow for now <LINE1> you cannot rush perfection <LINE2> maybe not that slow 
my head is bleeding <LINE1>  the zit i show is shameful <LINE2>  it burst while kissing 
a rickety bridge <LINE1> some wood laid across water <LINE2> somehow looks happy 
a storm from heaven <LINE1> rain pounding at the window <LINE2> it's all over now 
end times call for end <LINE1> measures mean nothing to the <LINE2> heart wants what it wants 
i failed once again <LINE1> a first step is what i need <LINE2> up i go today 
a little red breast <LINE1> your namesake visited me <LINE2> singing at sunset 
twisting and turning <LINE1> rippling falling crashing <LINE2> to the end of time 
every moment filled <LINE1> love service in each word deed <LINE2> let's walk together 
thought is your first friend <LINE1> helping and ruining your life <LINE2> but you can't leave her 
being for others <LINE1> there are no red hot pokers <LINE2> here we are in hell 
footprints in the snow <LINE1> critter looking for shelter <LINE2> resting place revealed 
the smell of leather <LINE1>  always helps me sleep but oh <LINE2>  my cheeks are stuck 
on wrist scars <LINE1>  far beyond the walls <LINE2> shooting stars 
wife working from home <LINE1> her diet is atrocious <LINE2> unless i'm cooking 
i saw you standing <LINE1> hand resting on heavy heart <LINE2> weeping for lost love 
how must it have been <LINE1>  for the failed apprentice of <LINE2>  the last alchemist 
the rains torment me <LINE1> droplets and downpours they both <LINE2> turn cold my feelings 
reseting windows <LINE1> folder options double click <LINE2> do i or don't i 
whipping winter wind <LINE1> window down going ninety <LINE2> anxiousness frozen 
rain pitter patters <LINE1> warm tea and biscuits <LINE2> she likes coffee 
soft warm autumn rain <LINE1> between the soggy gold leaves <LINE2>  worms come out to play 
caught in this cycle <LINE1> you'd think i'd learn by now <LINE2> still nothing to show 
the house of the sun <LINE1> leaves falling death birth rising <LINE2> all for you my love 
viral pandemic <LINE1> selling weed is essential <LINE2> stay medicated 
memories drowning <LINE1> every emotion adds tears <LINE2> buoyed by joy and hope

i wish i could fly <LINE1>  i'm not made of gasoline <LINE2>  or toll booth money 
my only desire <LINE1> to mend harm and suffering <LINE2> selfless compassion 
bright smile teary eyes <LINE1> she wears the same mask daily <LINE2> she'll get over it 
she didn't want kids <LINE1> took all the right precautions <LINE2> and then she bore twins 
leaves hold on no more <LINE1> the winds want to set you free <LINE2> take courage and fly 
cute little bubble <LINE1> dancing through the air bliss feels <LINE2> oh wait pop the end 
maybe a bird is <LINE1> wandering in far vision <LINE2> looking for it's prey 
every year we pass <LINE1> through the anniversary <LINE2> of our future death

treacherous mountain <LINE1> euphoric and troublesome <LINE2> new paramedic 
i saw her face here <LINE1>  looking out over the sea <LINE2>  then i fell in love 
time to say sorry <LINE1> to pause before i react <LINE2> renew everything 
crisp bubbles rising <LINE1> golden hues glimmering bright <LINE2> the smell of fresh hops 
here comes our bright star <LINE1> we are waiting for its light <LINE2> fear it but fear not 
cold ferocious winds <LINE1> they break the silence of night <LINE2> nature's warning voice 
i broke that birdbath <LINE1>  for you because i knew how <LINE2>  much you hated it 
decadent madness <LINE1>  i lie awake in the night <LINE2>  confounded by it

my palate transformed <LINE1> scorched ships crashed on the sea shore <LINE2> islay scotch whisky 
mittens are mugging <LINE1> a handle on skating with <LINE2> floating marshmallows 
early morning gym <LINE1>  sweating pushing breathing hard <LINE2>  what the utter fuck 
a happy bottom <LINE1>  reaches high into the air <LINE2> and lets out a fart

tear down lennon wall <LINE1> those patriotic students <LINE2> only wear supreme 
the seconds tick by <LINE1> every one a reminder <LINE2> she never called back 
the warmth of his skin <LINE1> supple with each conscious touch <LINE2> widens pleasantly 
what it is to be <LINE1> folded wings of a sparrow <LINE2> an unpicked apple 
i want to be yours <LINE1> put your head on my shoulder <LINE2> tell me you love me 
there's nothing sweeter <LINE1> than having the taste of you <LINE2> stained upon my lips 
dry country prevails <LINE1> the drought years of history <LINE2> threaten to return 
happy drinkers crowd <LINE1> autumn european streets <LINE2> carelessly strolling

a flame in the rain <LINE1> fought and flickered to its end <LINE2> may yours not follow 
at night in my room  <LINE1> collapsing in on myself <LINE2> singularity 
trotting in the yard <LINE1> a whimpered search continues <LINE2> no home for a bone 
a boy lay up high <LINE1> down the dry ground make him sad <LINE2> for that he will cry 
how the city lights <LINE1> make us feel like this is life <LINE2> and yet emptiness 
the winter growing <LINE1> i am like a bear snoring <LINE2> with blanket coating

growing apart us <LINE1> we live together alone <LINE2> how long til this ends 
down under the dirt <LINE1> they crawl and fight to survive <LINE2> they will soon find life 
it's funny that i can simultaneously dread <LINE1> an outcome while also wishing for it <LINE2> as to just end the anxiety 
thank you reddit friends <LINE1> always afraid to be heard <LINE2> but here i feel safe 
she calls above me <LINE1> ringing throughout this valley <LINE2> she sings of my home

when prayer released <LINE1> when in silence a tear forms <LINE2> there i find my love 
meeting on the field <LINE1> a fox spiritcomes along <LINE2> winter is coming 
i see words within <LINE1> black strokes dance around white space <LINE2> and so it is born 
smog clouds rain acid <LINE1> plastic strangles the ocean <LINE2> convenience is god 
the top of your head <LINE1>  passes a tiny window <LINE2>  i watch miles away 
under the lightless night <LINE1> a new flower blooms <LINE2> will be first will it be last 
best days passed quickly <LINE1> my dreams devoured by time <LINE2> the end seemed so far

her face to the storm <LINE1> unfazed by the lashing rain <LINE2> her will is greater

a colorful frenzy <LINE1>  summer dance of life <LINE2>  milkweed butterflies 
traveling abroad <LINE1> different places and foods <LINE2> i can't wait to go 
your life in the void <LINE1>  written as its told by pi <LINE2>  so many questions

anxiety grips <LINE1> racing heart into danger <LINE2> reality bends 
as the sunlight fades <LINE1> comforting darkness flows in <LINE2> with the scent of rain 
an ode to the pants <LINE1>  that won't fit us anyone <LINE2>  when this is done

patience is virtue <LINE1> eagerness not so much though <LINE2> believe me i tried 
golden leaves surround <LINE1> the last summer chickory <LINE2> glowing by the road 
a dance or a trance <LINE1> suspended tiny dust specs <LINE2>  projectors are cool 
help for i am high <LINE1> i eat my cereal wet <LINE2> or i eat it dry 
my cat takes over <LINE1> my desk and my entire life <LINE2> i really don't mind 
i am so damn bored <LINE1>  talking over and over <LINE2>  when will you shut up 
my words crest and fall <LINE1> like waves upon the shoreline <LINE2> in truth they're whale farts 
choose words carefully <LINE1> joyful quips said in sorrow <LINE2> may open new wounds 
lovealways seeking <LINE1> lovegiving it to others <LINE2> lovereturned to me

greetings to you all <LINE1> this seems to be a great place <LINE2>  i found a new home 
your storm is my storm <LINE1> in the eye we stand at peace <LINE2> our eternity 
a safe without key <LINE1> so too many memories <LINE2> for security 
then head over heels <LINE1> conclusion no concussion <LINE2> though two fucked up feet 
gotta wonder why <LINE1>  i feel so fly when my fly <LINE2>  is so freaking down 
chalk on the blackboard <LINE1> eyes focussed only on her <LINE2> serendipity 
a world framed in glass <LINE1> robbing senses of their worth <LINE2> giving sadness breath 
inside the dryer <LINE1> tumbling like a gymnast <LINE2> warm soft fluffy towels 
i am a retard <LINE1>  at least i am not alone <LINE2> we all bought gamestop 
her blue bucket hat <LINE1> keeps her cool in winter sun <LINE2> far too cool for me 
pithy words abound <LINE1> how could this happen to us <LINE2> you reap what you sow 
a brief encounter <LINE1> like a warm midsummer night <LINE2> on a november 
rhydon used earthquake <LINE1> it was super effective <LINE2> pikachu fainted 
if you put the whole <LINE1> cookie in your mouth at once <LINE2> you make fat less crumbs 
a slide thick with leaves <LINE1> children locked safely inside <LINE2> jumping from the couch 
love lasts in patients <LINE1> let dark scars and placid play <LINE2> come home to me soon 
the virus riots <LINE1>  deaths of legends and fires <LINE2>  this year's been decades 
in marriage i am <LINE1> a trellis where another <LINE2> biography grows 
autumn chill morning <LINE1> i have to wake up early <LINE2> just to smell fresh air 
accidental mix <LINE1>  sriracha on pineapple <LINE2>  happy haiku time 
constant temptation <LINE1> only with grace i resist <LINE2> god perfecting me 
rain freezing quickly <LINE1> branches overburdened break <LINE2> crashing to the ground 
if you love someone <LINE1> set them free they may return <LINE2> like a moth to flame 
weighing my future <LINE1> but instead of committing <LINE2> i worship the haze 
blood curdles like milk <LINE1> begging to burst from a hole <LINE2> dug fresh on the spot 
as summer ends <LINE1> the shades project their shadows <LINE2> warmth's comforting 
i cut down the wood <LINE1> i got splinters on my hands <LINE2> this house is a home 
the stinging is fine <LINE1> we must make friends with the pain <LINE2> and fight through today 
haha ur mom gay <LINE1> he said then turned away and <LINE2> got shot in the head 
with the setting sun <LINE1>  i too fall into slumber <LINE2>  stressful restless sleep 
high as a space kite <LINE1> a semiconductor eye <LINE2> gazes upon you 
tie string to my head <LINE1> keep me from drifting away <LINE2> fog clouds lift my mind 
i just had it here <LINE1> but it decided to leave <LINE2> where is my damn pen 
too many ideas <LINE1> procrastination present <LINE2> motivation gone 
alas the peak <LINE1> now to enjoy the descent <LINE2> celebrate the finish 
the lack of sleep peels <LINE1> layers of your mind away <LINE2> raw subconscious thoughts 
eyes open slowly <LINE1> a vague form lays beside me <LINE2> where now are my pants 
here is a good one <LINE1> longer than it ought to be <LINE2> monosyllabic 
sanguine afternoons <LINE1> pass like trees on the highway <LINE2> nights like the mountains 
we are each unique <LINE1> but not just anyone can <LINE2> make us feel special 
london suburbs <LINE1> fog fog enveloping the town <LINE2> intimate mornings 
dragonfly sunbathes <LINE1> petaled wings blooming fingers <LINE2> pluck air in presage 
dragging feet through haze  <LINE1> musing if the tempest will halt <LINE2> i hope spring shows up 
dressed in hoodies i <LINE1>  go to the wardrobe to stroke <LINE2>  my normal clothes soon 
many paths ahead <LINE1> yet my feet take me nowhere <LINE2> always uncertain 
writer writes some words <LINE1>  dance of syllables goes on <LINE2>  meaning never sure 
dogs should get married <LINE1> canines in matrimony <LINE2> not just puppy love 
display true honor <LINE1> place your sword upon the leaves <LINE2> feed your family 
an early morning <LINE1> thunderstorm lashing city <LINE2> who wanted more sleep 
people tap their feet <LINE1> the line grows even longer <LINE2> forgot my wallet 
a glass of wine is  <LINE1> a poem itself the last  <LINE2> sip is another 
love is a calm sea <LINE1> unmoved by the rushing wind <LINE2> thoughts become silence 
the stereos blare <LINE1> wailing auditory waste <LINE2> poison's terrible 
at the grand canyon <LINE1> truly a sight to behold <LINE2> it goes on for miles 
a strange toad licked me <LINE1> i licked the strange toad right back <LINE2> and now i see things 
an ocean of shale <LINE1> couldn't keep lovers apart <LINE2> weeds reach for the sun 
plunging the toilet <LINE1> doing cpr on it <LINE2> so now it can flush 
i wish you were here <LINE1>  i want to make you happy <LINE2>  but i don't know how 
i say when we sell <LINE1> ten million is the floor <LINE2> apes love diamond hands 
traces of lovers <LINE1> linger in scent and on skin <LINE2> your heart left untouched 
problems block my path <LINE1> but like yesterday i say <LINE2> maybe tomorrow 
five o'clock whistle <LINE1> a rainbow fades away between <LINE2> the neighbors' chimneys 
thunder bee <LINE1> hurting and scary <LINE2> soothes sweetly 
i know its a trick <LINE1> i'll play along morning sun <LINE2>  i know you will leave 
the cave at the beach <LINE1> pulls in the cold winter sea <LINE2> where last spring i posed 
maskless in the store <LINE1> just raw doggin oxygen <LINE2> i feel like a slut 
looking for the words <LINE1> in the bosom of the fire <LINE2> waning crescent moon 
synthetic kinship <LINE1> reasonably priced pleasure <LINE2> not quite ecstasy 
bittersweet ending <LINE1> love earned through a hard fight lost <LINE2> you're crying not me 
my mind swirls her scent <LINE1> visions and dreams commence <LINE2> my heart is captured 
standing back to back <LINE1> guarding against the wild world <LINE2> what lurks between us 
up anchor set sail <LINE1> bow to forces underway <LINE2> stern words for all men 
do you ever wonder <LINE1> which christmas <LINE2> will be your last 
yes i work from home <LINE1> no i don't shower daily <LINE2> disgusting you bet 
hey we all make trash <LINE1>  but know only some of us <LINE2>  do recycle it 
this anxiety <LINE1> goes not softly in the night <LINE2> it screams and it screams 
the first of spring's rains <LINE1> the first of the redbud's blooms <LINE2> the first geese head north 
red covered bridges <LINE1> water rushing underneath <LINE2> carrying the leaves 
i am stressed and sad <LINE1> why does nothing go my way <LINE2> i messed up again 
winged cherubs take flight <LINE1> into moonlight's hazed grandeur <LINE2> numerous as stars 
this is a haiku <LINE1> i didn't really try <LINE2> bing bang boom goodbye 
so young yet so lost <LINE1> her eye's fire once burned bright <LINE2> now gone in the cold 
this day your way lord <LINE1> grace empowers thoughts words deeds <LINE2> overfilled with joy 
alexa's all ears <LINE1> not just when you speak to her <LINE2> class action lawsuit 
golden rays of sun <LINE1>  a lovely weaving of light <LINE2>  cascading about 
challenging yourself <LINE1> determined to go forward <LINE2> one step at a time 
today i will learn <LINE1> tomorrow i will forget <LINE2> sun rises anyway 
net neutrality <LINE1> is going to go away <LINE2> stupid fcc 
the journey begins <LINE1> a grand quest to mow a lawn <LINE2> one man and his bike 
sunny winter morn <LINE1> melts away yesterdays fun <LINE2> someone lost a glove 
harsh words burst forth pain <LINE1> flashing from my heart they were <LINE2> a lesson for me 
monday morning blues <LINE1> another bus passes by <LINE2> late to work again 
my boss pees golden <LINE1> showers of wisdom we are <LINE2> pissed on and pissed off 
divorce is the price <LINE1> half pay so we all can dare <LINE2> to believe in love 
hummers dance and whirl <LINE1>  just a sip sustains their speed <LINE2>  honeysuckle blooms 
cyclone from nowhere <LINE1> with a terrifying name <LINE2> bombogenesis 
buried deep within <LINE1> in stillness dark lady weeps <LINE2> she once had a soul 
volcanic temptress <LINE1>  blowing kisses of dark ash <LINE2>  beckon me closer 
rain wakes the dark earth <LINE1> emerald blades thrusting forth <LINE2> hope springs eternal 
blazing like the sun <LINE1> passion reigniting my soul <LINE2> purpose found again 
give thanks for today <LINE1> for you can eat all you want <LINE2> and not feel guilty 
in between spaces <LINE1> an awareness of silence <LINE2> listen in presence 
no eggs nor his hat <LINE1> read across america  <LINE2> has cancelled the cat 
the eyes of a cat <LINE1> be it love or agression <LINE2> always look the same 
first time bunking class <LINE1> python java script has been tough <LINE2> bunking to catch up 
i am not my thoughts <LINE1> in and through they come and go <LINE2> but still i remain 
one should realize <LINE1> that other people's progress <LINE2> is not your failure 
company for mars <LINE1> shades of red fill the night sky <LINE2> blood moon on the rise 
suck start a shotgun <LINE1> much thicker than a milkshake <LINE2> a forbidden treat 
shoes tucked beneath our arms <LINE1> we wade through sun steeped water <LINE2> and brush against tall grass 
a few thousand bees <LINE1> vomiting drops of nectar <LINE2> for your banana 
smoking cigarettes <LINE1> addicting and destructive <LINE2> like you were to me 
my only desire <LINE1> to end harm and suffering <LINE2>  selfless compassion 
i love you like words <LINE1> want to be spoken yet still <LINE2> long to be whispered 
three cold hard boulders <LINE1> scuffed by wind and rain and sand <LINE2> protect a tortoise 
watch the earth decline <LINE1> at the point of no return <LINE2> gaze new beginnings 
roses from a seed <LINE1> petals flowing in the wind <LINE2> beauty of flowers 
i feel tired <LINE1>  one after the other <LINE2>  at some point i'll stop 
i wish i could live <LINE1>  in the glimpses of myself <LINE2>  i saw in your eyes 
day by day you love <LINE1> my lord step by step you lead <LINE2> how awesome you are 
i age in mirrors <LINE1> regrets and fears stir my soul <LINE2> clocks never rewind 
i thought that i could haiku <LINE1> seven five seven <LINE2> turns out i was wrong bugger 
drifting morning fog <LINE1> rivulets gather and wash <LINE2> over broken trees 
said you needed space <LINE1> 'cause you hated the distance <LINE2> now we're just distant 
democracy is <LINE1> rarely practiced in lifeboats <LINE2> real or imagined 
my five am tea <LINE1> billowing clouds of white steam <LINE2> i wait while it cools 
'round my soul a sheer <LINE1> gossamer restrains all my <LINE2> ambition and shame 
a drink too many <LINE1> brings these feelings aplenty <LINE2> must rebuild the dam 
ten cubes <LINE1> five music notes <LINE2> became of them 
this ain't a haiku <LINE1> though it follows the format <LINE2> that happened by chance 
computers for peace <LINE1> application developers <LINE2> declare var not war 
to consume the earth <LINE1> seemed impossible until <LINE2> i unhinged my jaw 
hiding the plain truth <LINE1> you control the narrative <LINE2> making sins vanish 
always love for us <LINE1> the gifts and graces we need <LINE2> each stroke perfects us 
sunshine through fog <LINE1> silhouetted tree branches <LINE2> long grass grey with dew 
what does not kill you <LINE1> will still haunt you afterwards <LINE2> but they will soon fade 
vaguely familiar <LINE1> another boring birthday <LINE2> not much you can do 
why has it taken <LINE1> so long to do in a word <LINE2> procrastination 
uh oh trouble now <LINE1> haiku police will show how <LINE2> writing should be wow 
jingle all the way <LINE1>  sequel was disappointing <LINE2>  no schwarzenegger 
rainy saturday <LINE1> coffee break to ease the hurt <LINE2> fragile solitude 
i have often thought <LINE1> of friends who drifted away <LINE2> now i fight the breeze 
we were always good <LINE1> at discussing our feelings <LINE2> but not talk of love 
i wish i had friends <LINE1> then i would not write haikus <LINE2> in my room alone 
she the huntress strikes <LINE1>  in a flash her prey is won <LINE2>  ninja in darkness 
how long shall i wait <LINE1> as the time stands still for me <LINE2> seasons come and go 
recently bought plants <LINE1>  green serenity at last <LINE2>  can't wait to kill you 
my eyelids a dam <LINE1> ready to flood the cities <LINE2> i cannot hold it 
moonrise claims the sky <LINE1> a rebirth seizing the day <LINE2> overflowing light 
the ground is thawing <LINE1> i hear the birds singing songs <LINE2> come alive it's time 
woof woof heard the man <LINE1> had it not came from a babe <LINE2> he may have heard wolf 
on cold nights like these <LINE1> all i want is to warm up <LINE2> by your hair of fire 
boring office day <LINE1> but outside of the window <LINE2> swallows are stunting 
the blades keep turning <LINE1> staring up while the clock ticks <LINE2> cage made of drywall 
so sure of yourself <LINE1> if you act without hindsight <LINE2> guilt will consume you 
hands grasping their neck <LINE1> clutching until there's no air <LINE2> i did this for you 
the morning sunshine <LINE1> with you gently by my side <LINE2> red streaks in the air 
whatchoo wanna do <LINE1> make me wanna shoop baby <LINE2> you make me wanna 
night in a city <LINE1> illuminated darkness <LINE2> stars covered by light 
tonight no tv <LINE1> perhaps i'll be a poet <LINE2> it could set me free 
the x marks the spot <LINE1> no guide no topography <LINE2> bad cartography 
divorce the big d <LINE1> how did we lose each other <LINE2> we really screwed up 
insipid scuttles <LINE1> over floors of empty lots <LINE2> these leaves are zombies 
attacks on freedom <LINE1>  the wealthy steal the country <LINE2>  cummings the lead rat 
the summertime breeze <LINE1> resurfaces memories <LINE2> that i never had 
after me made love <LINE1> we laid together in bliss <LINE2> under peaceful snow 
patience is the key <LINE1> they say but god i'm waiting <LINE2> been here for ages 
to you i now write <LINE1> a letter with no reply <LINE2> there is no more 
a calm mind shatters <LINE1> a voice rumbles in my brain <LINE2> mouths move in silence 
swing a sword or swing <LINE1>  pendulums hours we in sync <LINE2>  pandamonium 
i am full of fear <LINE1> i start things i can give up <LINE2> not things that matter 
pour in the city <LINE1> the smell of heated asphalt <LINE2> between the raindrops 
my anus quivers <LINE1> faggoted virginity <LINE2> taken by niggers 
the tides of time turn <LINE1> our lives are eaten away like <LINE2> rocks on the windy shores 
rightful and yet wrong <LINE1> proud and yet miserable <LINE2> it all goes away 
saffron rose petals <LINE1> tumble on journal pages <LINE2> blue ink afternoon 
these times feel alone <LINE1> bottom of everyone's list <LINE2> inner heart survives 
what are you hiding <LINE1> what do you not want to say <LINE2> what do you feel fear 
it's been a long time <LINE1> since i posted a haiku <LINE2> maybe tomorrow 
the archer takes aim <LINE1> a blue eye through thin crosshairs <LINE2> fruit succumbs to steel 
the damaged car and <LINE1> attempts to resuscitate <LINE2> both were towed for parts 
my favourite chore <LINE1> during frosty weather is <LINE2> feeding chickadees 
she saw my first breath <LINE1> but now i have seen her last <LINE2> i miss great grandma 
minds playing cursive <LINE1> spiral down like a staircase <LINE2> but to what extreme 
cardinal greeting <LINE1> your eminence i said and <LINE2> scattered stipend seeds 
hurdles before me <LINE1> so many stop now never <LINE2> grace is all i need 
who am i but one <LINE1> unlovable soul stood still <LINE2>  just wishing for love 
adrift in wonders <LINE1>  as life passes before me <LINE2>  hath i enjoyed it 
come holy spirit <LINE1> perfect for us is your grace <LINE2> love never ending 
the blue ridge parkway <LINE1> our personal get away <LINE2> missing it today 
steamy dark liquid <LINE1>  lucidity in the fog <LINE2>  morning is for us 
impromptu poet <LINE1> word hash unsalted verbage <LINE2> flavorless haiku 
dusty afternoon <LINE1> coffee rice and toasted bread <LINE2> i miss you nana 
no color the same <LINE1> but under the moon and stars <LINE2> we all wear midnight 
let's go somewhere far <LINE1> supported by the south wind <LINE2> our endless journey 
united for life <LINE1> one in love one in purpose <LINE2> loving our journey 
do not stand or sit <LINE1> the rope creeks as it tightens <LINE2> slippers hit the floor 
drizzling winter day <LINE1> no work nor tramping outside <LINE2> ah second breakfast 
i want to go home <LINE1> the only place i feel safe <LINE2> the warmth of his arms 
nobuyuki plays <LINE1> the gods stop to watch and cry <LINE2> the blind pianist

a loss of control <LINE1> overwhelming sensation <LINE2> nothing but regret 
twirling yellow leaves <LINE1>  the crisp air bellows through trees <LINE2>  orange mosaic 
the past is haunting <LINE1> help release me from this curse <LINE2> then love can blossom 
i imagine us <LINE1> as sea otters holding hands <LINE2> to not drift apart 
why did i sell out <LINE1>  giving my gifts to strangers <LINE2>  it should have been you 
love shared glorious <LINE1> love bonds even in darkness <LINE2> love is all we need 
cold anvil of grief <LINE1>  my aching arms carry you <LINE2>  while my love runs free 
surround they were <LINE1> all my choices the exit <LINE2> where can it be found 
i could nudge you now <LINE1>  but then you might awaken <LINE2>  keep snoring my love 
a kiss for your brow <LINE1> my lips brush so close to yours <LINE2> good morning my love 
a sweet salty treat <LINE1> but man makes me so thirsty <LINE2> no water so blood 
i like things meta <LINE1>  and i also like haikus <LINE2>  guess i'll merge the two 
you need to tell me <LINE1> even though i know it all <LINE2> and i know you do 
sitting by the phone <LINE1> waiting for her to reply <LINE2> but she never does

the sun shines above <LINE1>  my sons rolling in the grass <LINE2>  i seek the cool shade 
planning my escape <LINE1> to where the grass is greener <LINE2> one step at a time 
a catty remark <LINE1> swiped across the heart leaving <LINE2> a razor sharp sting 
children journeying <LINE1> sharing joy sorrow hopes dreams <LINE2> energized by truth

legend of zelda <LINE1>  link's awakening is just <LINE2>  the absolute best 
he hid like she did <LINE1> a mirror to her facade <LINE2> it was unpleasant 
ashes to ashes <LINE1> collecting fiery feathers <LINE2> as we spiral down 
caught in a corner <LINE1> the paper tablecloth whirls <LINE2> practicing its dance 
seven deadly sins <LINE1> could it really hurt that much <LINE2> to commit just one 
fully elated <LINE1> my heart never beat so quickly <LINE2> i want this always

karma is a bitch <LINE1> but only if i insist <LINE2> on provoking her 
words cheap in value <LINE1> deeds accomplishments treasured <LINE2> do more than say more 
strange temperate winter <LINE1> warms january jasmine <LINE2> perfume in the mist

rain clouds and sunshine <LINE1> arcs of colour through the sky <LINE2> she's my pot of gold 
an alarm ringing <LINE1> a child given an award <LINE2> my dreams have been lost 
vultures so hungry <LINE1>  it is the circle of life <LINE2>  what makes your flesh great 
caught in the moment <LINE1> pulled under by grief and loss <LINE2> swift the river runs

oh my you and i <LINE1> before now tomorrowlove <LINE2> never will we end 
meaningless haiku <LINE1> layered sparsely with meaning <LINE2> means nothing at all 
my dog licks my arm <LINE1> during tonight's thunderstorm <LINE2> with her eyes closed shut 
the flavor of dogs <LINE1> mingling with the boardwalk and <LINE2> relished on a bun 
stand up for yourself <LINE1> you're your greatest advocate <LINE2> fighting warrior 
attention drifting <LINE1> i tell myself to focus <LINE2> don't like statistics 
the iron cannon <LINE1> loaded in peacetime with the <LINE2> birds packing a truce 
before the white death <LINE1> a ghost in the trenches lay <LINE2> a spirit of the wind 
two flags one nation  <LINE1> what an abomination <LINE2> need a salvation 
in the shadows dark <LINE1> the joker is listening <LINE2> take care how you speak 
yo no entiendo <LINE1> learnt that for my cuban trip <LINE2> then got overcharged 
you only can only read <LINE1>  all haikus this easily <LINE2> thanks to jacksfilm's song 
imagine my shock <LINE1> the blood all left my body <LINE2> where could it have gone 
a torrent of thought <LINE1> spills the banks of consciousness <LINE2> washing life away 
husband is away <LINE1> blinds down door locked phone off hook <LINE2> a secret affair 
your mouth shook gaining <LINE1> the character of a book <LINE2> carried through danger 
all those moments lost <LINE1> like tears in summer showers <LINE2> washed away by time 
why is no one here <LINE1> in a room full of people  <LINE2> someone listen up 
losing her edge while <LINE1> strutting with the collie and <LINE2> elimination 
restless eyes open <LINE1> dark light fills the void with ease <LINE2> dreams are not promised 
blinding white moonlight <LINE1> the red figure stands proudly <LINE2> while the eyes still gaze 
now i will be blunt <LINE1> optimism's struggle cold <LINE2> all of it pointless 
your words for me read <LINE1> absent are your emotions <LINE2> dreaming of presence 
i changed my core <LINE1> to fit around you the best <LINE2> i could and it failed 
craving games outside <LINE1> conversations over drinks <LINE2> summer fun again 
cool breeze in the night <LINE1> whispers drown out the ringing <LINE2> restless without them 
shadows hazards diversions <LINE1> straight path crooked walk forward <LINE2> goal in focus 
how interesting <LINE1> one song can still stall my heart <LINE2> duet turned solo 
waves against the beach <LINE1> infinite force of nature <LINE2> violent yet at peace 
you were invited <LINE1> why did you leave so quickly <LINE2> loving you always 
wet leaves <LINE1>  steam from the tea <LINE2>  warmth of your skin 
pink clouds on blue sky <LINE1> reflecting the moon's daylight <LINE2> night round the corner 
you were nice to me <LINE1> when i had no faith in me <LINE2> i want to say thanks 
autumn convinces <LINE1> the trees to part from their leaves <LINE2> and let them fall free 
music and daydreams <LINE1> so profound i drown they end <LINE2> i am here again 
tragedy heartbreak <LINE1> something we all encounter <LINE2>  you will push through this 
haikus in this sub <LINE1> are a fun way to help me <LINE2> forget about you 
place here nature words <LINE1> now for some descriptive words <LINE2> i wrote a haiku 
dry rocks and boulders <LINE1> bake under pitiless sun <LINE2> where is the river 
what does it mean when <LINE1> i want nobody else but <LINE2> it hurts to be here 
yesterday's haiku <LINE1> means nothing whatsoever <LINE2> no bridge no water 
atmospheric room <LINE1> talks fueled by curious minds <LINE2> strangers turn to friends 
whichever i pick <LINE1> indica or sativa <LINE2> which star to shoot for 
remember when we <LINE1> took a bath while the world was <LINE2> burning around us 
darkened afternoon <LINE1> warmer days a memory <LINE2> snow fluttering by 
perennial stream <LINE1> swift in heart flow my mind <LINE2> looming consequence 
vegas chlorine pool <LINE1> shines with the hot summer sun <LINE2> playfully waves on 
to see it again <LINE1>  makes me warm happy inside <LINE2>  that sweet smile of yours 
youtube video <LINE1> glasses with his violin <LINE2> will you love me too 
this drunken evening <LINE1> i used you as a toilet <LINE2> just a little joke 
beauty in struggle <LINE1> the emotions of my past <LINE2> listen to music 
i died in my sleep <LINE1> somebody needs to tell me <LINE2> how i wake back up 
gang mentalities <LINE1> explain their brutality <LINE2> 'to serve and protect' 
the virus rages <LINE1> a month later and i still <LINE2> cannot catch my breath 
a cold winters night <LINE1> drifts by in the inky swirl <LINE2> there shines 'silver pearl' 
the united states <LINE1> land of depressed broken scared <LINE2>  after all its home 
someone once told me <LINE1> become the rose that grows in <LINE2> between the concrete 
wine tastes different <LINE1>  if you take a sip alone <LINE2>  or among good friends 
my dreams are full now <LINE1> your color your temperature <LINE2> pressed behind my eyes 
each dandelion <LINE1> we made wishes together <LINE2> i wished yours came true 
dreams can flee <LINE1> through the bushes and out of sight <LINE2> hunt them 
we are like microbes <LINE1> zits and blackheads and pock marks <LINE2> on earths graceful skin 
i want to die now <LINE1> put a bullet in my skull <LINE2> will i regret this 
link by link by link <LINE1> the internet grows bigger <LINE2> now it spans the globe 
this syllable count <LINE1>  if we could all just have one more <LINE2>  i would be most hap 
miles separate us <LINE1> yet we're inseparable <LINE2> i know it will last 
confession of love <LINE1> when seen as motivation <LINE2> becomes one of guilt 
cell phone poetry <LINE1>  rhythms hiding in plain sight <LINE2>  time to call my mom 
the heat of the scotch <LINE1> kindles a warm memory <LINE2> to happier times 
in dark moon shadows <LINE1>  my blade reflects around <LINE2>  a petal is cut 
you look different now <LINE1> the same love a different feel <LINE2> sorry i'm not sure 
ah the rain returns <LINE1> beautiful morning to sleep <LINE2> but there are babies 
found an open book <LINE1> rosetta stone unwritten <LINE2> read between the lines 
sleepless solitude <LINE1> sleeping next to wrong person <LINE2> both are lonely nights 
soy marihuano <LINE1> las nubes en mi cuarto <LINE2> ojos estrellados 
how do you expect <LINE1> to find love in this time of <LINE2> social distancing 
oh zero zero <LINE1> how negative whoa is me <LINE2> pee stain on my jeans 
refrigerator <LINE1> homosexuality <LINE2> all the gays are cool 
i love who you are <LINE1>  to me a light in darkness <LINE2>  a joy in my world 
my heart palpatates <LINE1> all these people i don't know <LINE2> watch me bare my soul 
as this year's roots spread <LINE1> they will no doubt interact <LINE2> with last year's corpses 
sunlight through the blinds <LINE1> a lazy sunday with you <LINE2> pizza for breakfast 
afraid to touch and <LINE1> ignight the spark inside us <LINE2> raging inferno 
her prerogative <LINE1> was elaborate sequins <LINE2> beading into ice 
watching the flames eat away <LINE1> the logs in my fire <LINE2> fascinating spectacle 
tears bond us <LINE1> joy propels each step together <LINE2> energized by love 
silly orange man <LINE1> stuck in ways yet still unfazed <LINE2> head buried in sand 
massive jaws stretched wide <LINE1> gaping to consume the sun <LINE2> screaming constantly 
sweet thoughts and kind words <LINE1> now gone once taken for granted <LINE2> lonely life burns out 
an old orange bantam <LINE1> strutting proud with borrowed spurs <LINE2> fails to see the fox 
the buzz wearing off <LINE1> his doll deflating slowly <LINE2> sir please it hisses 
luke skywalker dies <LINE1> kylo ren kills master snoke <LINE2> princess leia lives 
death is the end right <LINE1> so why am i still awake <LINE2> i feel everything 
tell me when and where <LINE1> and for you i will be there <LINE2> twenty minutes late 
the dry grass hums <LINE1> ants are awakened <LINE2> and go searching for dew 
the equaliser <LINE1> the task at hand with eyes closed <LINE2> cosmic impacts loom 
blindly i'm fumbling <LINE1> hoping the lights turn on soon <LINE2> wait where are my eyes 
who loves the spider <LINE1> even worse than the mosqiutoes <LINE2> no we hate them both 
i'm new to reddit <LINE1> this sub has piqued my interest <LINE2> it's pure poetry 
nectar to honey <LINE1> but this bee need not flower <LINE2> sweetness is in all 
the golden hew fades <LINE1> violet extending forth <LINE2> all encompassing 
from seed to the top <LINE1> branches all under the sun <LINE2>  a pleasant shadow 
mocking bird wonder <LINE1> tiny fractures on stained sheets <LINE2> the bottle silent 
going back in time <LINE1>  when trojan was a present <LINE2>  not a virus 
your presence my joy <LINE1> god's plan for you and ilove <LINE2> so blessed are we all 
sitting here i be <LINE1> writing this haiku for you <LINE2> hoping to see green 
solitary thoughts <LINE1>  thinking of good times we had <LINE2>  face to the fall wind 
today i have learned <LINE1> split sentences unwelcome <LINE2> still learning mercy 
as the time ticks by <LINE1> i mindlessly fill the void <LINE2> but still wait for you 
afternoon drizzle <LINE1> bird wings flapping in a puddle <LINE2> its bath time 
like everything else <LINE1> self awareness it turns out <LINE2> always relative 
ātman and brahman <LINE1> what boundary between them <LINE2> all is anattā 
online piracy <LINE1> not a crime without victims <LINE2> hurting creators 
at the long table <LINE1> when trying not to take sides <LINE2> the world turns below 
time will bend for me <LINE1> roaming in the twilight hour <LINE2> i have been set free 
humans aren't we all <LINE1> just pieces of the same leaf <LINE2> leaves of the same tree 
cute critter crawler <LINE1>  consuming to cocooning <LINE2>  then boom butterfly 
many books to read <LINE1> hidden behind these walls <LINE2> knowledge gained today 
i stumble to sleep <LINE1>  on the soft stones of cartoons <LINE2>  and padded voices 
these cold winter nights <LINE1> speaking in whispers they weep <LINE2> turning the last page 
lonesome streetlight glow <LINE1> families stir in their homes <LINE2> america sleeps 
got all my stuff moved  <LINE1> carried boxes all day long  <LINE2> oh my achin' back 
hometown memories <LINE1> never forget where you're from <LINE2> nostalgia and more 
outside looking in <LINE1> a spirit between two worlds <LINE2> so close yet so far 
no one ever will <LINE1> take haikus as serious as <LINE2> real poetry 
the ice king cometh  <LINE1> dealing death where life once stood <LINE2> our saviour jon snow 
this is the end part <LINE1> here i'm adhered and not here <LINE2> here we go again 
anxious gardeners <LINE1> hurl debris into calm lakes <LINE2> turbulent waters 
your fluids <LINE1> my desire <LINE2> one body for two 
should have known better <LINE1> you said you wouldn't ghost me <LINE2> now i'm stuck guessing 
middle or upper <LINE1> can't tell by looking at them <LINE2> they're the bourgeoisie 
the promise of flight <LINE1>  waiting in this concrete tomb <LINE2>  stuck at the airport 
your hidden struggles <LINE1> how i pray in love for grace <LINE2> please take my handwalk 
when life is clouded <LINE1>  when we forget who we were <LINE2>  how can we return 
the world is so cool <LINE1> you can do a lot of things <LINE2> yet somehow i don't 
one swipe to the right <LINE1> a chat a coffee a walk <LINE2> one kiss told me all 
a youthful car and <LINE1> aging face with frazzled hair <LINE2> rebelling the truth 
coronavirus <LINE1> fever dry cough maybe death  <LINE2> grab all the bog roll 
bookends you and i <LINE1> a story of love between <LINE2> lord thank you so much 
stuck in this prison <LINE1> shackled by complacency <LINE2> bound by laziness 
sunshine kiss the moon <LINE1>  wind chymes rattle the window <LINE2>  eternally still 
should i be dragged down  <LINE1> if my ball and chain are so  <LINE2> so comfortable 
understand your pain <LINE1>  there is wisdom to be gained <LINE2>  in rumination 
faint rosey skyline <LINE1> with just a clear red comet <LINE2> of an aeroplane 
solitary tree <LINE1>  ornaments of pink petals <LINE2>  a black bird perches 
it's over she said <LINE1> as we sat down for dinner <LINE2> words cold as the food 
connected hearts minds <LINE1> just a look is all it took <LINE2> pilgrimswe journey 
before the virus <LINE1> travel was an adventure <LINE2> now it instills dread 
our whispering minds <LINE1> make us our own enemies <LINE2> to fight every day 
the bubbling molasses <LINE1> of black worry's soup conceals <LINE2> the dumpling of light 
leftovers of your <LINE1> existence spread around the <LINE2> apartment we shared 
man walks into bar <LINE1> and says i'd like a haiku <LINE2> the barman says sorry 
always wanting more <LINE1> time to get up and get it <LINE2> today is the day 
indecision <LINE1> sweep it all under the rug <LINE2>  rat in a dead cage 
worldly joy tempts me <LINE1> at what cost brief is the high <LINE2> teach me lord this day 
my eyes are heavy <LINE1> sleep calls but falls on deaf ears <LINE2> i must finish this 
that music <LINE1> all i have left <LINE2> of a life gone 
illicit affair <LINE1> lusting half a world away <LINE2> longing to be near

once again on app <LINE1> to find one to sit on lap <LINE2> sadly i look crap 
rotting in wisdom <LINE1>  housing forgotten answers <LINE2>  i am the old house 
calm waters calm mind <LINE1> darkness fades in brilliant light <LINE2> we rise together 
past the swaying oak <LINE1>  a traveling peony <LINE2>  guided by the stars 
with every upvote <LINE1> we slowly improve reddit <LINE2> upvote this haiku 
she's as sweet as a peach <LINE1> but still i think of someone <LINE2> that's sour as grapes 
after springtime rain <LINE1> beautiful flowers sprout up <LINE2> brilliantly blooming 
work afternoon lacking words to use <LINE1> would like to have energy <LINE2> challenge to go on 
cellphones are blinding <LINE1> our eyes see only false light <LINE2> look up and be free 
everlasting life <LINE1> transcending above the cloud <LINE2> password protected 
courage softens the <LINE1> ground beneath intrepid feet <LINE2> as we launch skyward 
you knew everything <LINE1> transcendent presence of bliss <LINE2> did you have to go 
i could leave my mark <LINE1> anywhere in this city <LINE2> but i choose this van 
as it envelops <LINE1>  carnivorous fog whispers <LINE2>  devour the light 
though once thought quite straight <LINE1> rio oceania <LINE2> brought scrunched tough sprawled shores 
what's left of the trees <LINE1>  howls beside the interstate <LINE2>  anxious men honk back 
a human being <LINE1> seeking relevance becomes <LINE2> a human doing 
take the cherokee <LINE1> sell their life to bourgeoise <LINE2> made now japaney 
hello mother moon <LINE1>  the tide swells at your behest <LINE2>  sleep well in your glow 
viceroy and monarch <LINE1> mimic just by happenstance <LINE2> me my own genus 
a great world so vast <LINE1> to be plagued by cruelty <LINE2> makes my young heart weep 
my master calls me <LINE1> electronic sound commands <LINE2> my shiny smartphone 
breezy summer night <LINE1> where a lonely brave knight dances <LINE2> betrayed by the star 
what we want often <LINE1> won't reflect reality <LINE2> sadly this is life 
spent my day alone <LINE1> again i think about you <LINE2> until tomorrow 
gentle thoughtful care <LINE1>  as dawn breaks so will she too <LINE2>  wounds nursed in the dark 
like two ships adrift <LINE1> somehow we found each other <LINE2> and saw the sunrise 
when your world goes gray <LINE1>  i will pinch your cheeks until <LINE2>  the red absolves you 
no nut november <LINE1> some say it's a real challenge <LINE2> lol vasectomy gang 
death will soon take you <LINE1> and all of the ones you love <LINE2> inevitably 
to define myself <LINE1> ordinary ideas <LINE2> into abstract love 
the gold sands of time <LINE1> through delicate glass they fall <LINE2> unique fall for all 
what is learned and made <LINE1> revealing meaning in life <LINE2> for humanity 
a crow caws softer <LINE1> a hummingbird monkey bars <LINE2> haunted dreams swingset 
the entrance of spring <LINE1> reawakening the earth <LINE2> sunlight sky a gift 
when effort leaves you <LINE1> the way envelops all life <LINE2> the current is swift 
graffiti obscured <LINE1> nature reclaimed our old spot <LINE2> my best friend is gone 
feelings can be hard <LINE1> life is simpler without them <LINE2> joy's a feeling too 
illuminating <LINE1> the space between the stars <LINE2> the silver moon sails 
i envy you thief <LINE1> the moon must be delicious  <LINE2> judging by your grin 
the wind ripples clouds <LINE1> on the waters glassy face <LINE2> a duck chases bread 
crystal was displayed <LINE1> but fell in shattered glass with <LINE2> wind bumping the trees 
pounding head heart soul <LINE1>  lungs burn no end in sight <LINE2>  freedom in this pace 
trying times my friends <LINE1> let contentedness sooth you <LINE2> simple values true 
is a haiku re <LINE1> ally just cutting words mid sen <LINE2> tence to get the count 
scattered feathers betray <LINE1> last night's passionate hunt <LINE2> and now the fox sleeps 
together we hold <LINE1>  with steel balls and diamond hands <LINE2>  striving for the moon 
to women's libbers <LINE1> don't strive for equality <LINE2> strive to be greater 
now tipped upside down <LINE1> a single grain a moment <LINE2> the sands of time flow 
representatives <LINE1> elected to speak for us <LINE2> often prefer cash 
blankets on the ground <LINE1> staring up at satellites <LINE2> summer writes itself 
a sapphire orb <LINE1> its frosted to perfection <LINE2> i love blueberries 
beneath the night sky <LINE1> golden embers giving warmth <LINE2> marshmallows are burnt 
too quickly the words <LINE1> love intended not given <LINE2> rocky is the road 
laying on your back <LINE1> underneath the glowing green <LINE2> summer luxury 
gray sky snow falling <LINE1>  a lone chickadee's peeping <LINE2>  heard miles away 
ground shakes again in japan <LINE1> everything destroyed again <LINE2> tress don't seem to care 
friday the thirteenth <LINE1>  not a good day for most folks <LINE2>  superstitious swine 
a bite not enough <LINE1> hunger rising <LINE2> the flower elusive 
to heal my spirit <LINE1> i must meditate at dawn <LINE2> god give me the strength 
strutting his size the <LINE1> flexing thunderhead had burst <LINE2> into clapping bolts 
the summertime jazz <LINE1>  like salsa through sinuses <LINE2>  opens up spirits 
i sit my temper <LINE1> down <LINE2> in the cold mist 
last few nights in town <LINE1> freedom from a draining clock <LINE2> no holding back now 
cozy red couches <LINE1> music from the old times <LINE2> fully relaxed 
a birds morning song <LINE1> a whistling in the wind <LINE2> the world awakens 
i received your love <LINE1> how short was the time we shared <LINE2> till we meet again 
i fight for my right <LINE1> and i live for the thrillers <LINE2> just not all the time 
president moron <LINE1> how could it have come to this <LINE2> vote in november 
mosquitoes are huge <LINE1>  i feel like a blood donor <LINE2>  i need to lay down 
fog rolls through my mind <LINE1> sluggishly i move about <LINE2> a long day ahead 
i spotted a bird <LINE1> it derailed my train of thought <LINE2> i failed my classes 
fire and wind embrace <LINE1> babes dancing to thunder's beat <LINE2>  wind carries the heat 
breezy is nudging <LINE1> conifer conversations <LINE2> whispering to sky 
in dark we make light <LINE1> in silence we can make sound <LINE2> in this world poems 
she screamed out oh god <LINE1> i know she an atheist <LINE2> she must not hate this 
try to be less of <LINE1> a fucking piece of shit than <LINE2> you were yesterday 
steep hill before us <LINE1> friends together we will climb <LINE2> god guides and provides 
marooned on an isle <LINE1> with no chance of a rescue <LINE2> his heart ached for her 
pushed out of the nest <LINE1>  now realizing i can fly <LINE2>  thank you for leaving 
you loved my green eyes <LINE1> like a walk in the forest <LINE2> now lost forever 
prance delightfully <LINE1> then give me aids mightily <LINE2> male ballerinas 
a cracked open cocoon  <LINE1> the butterfly stares at the endless landscape  <LINE2> from a cobweb 
accumulating debt <LINE1> when the world doesn't end <LINE2> i'll meet my maker 
on my tongue dreaming <LINE1> as sparrows sing now in bloom <LINE2> wishing star rise up 
shitty little poem <LINE1> thanks for letting me hide my <LINE2> quirky ugly thoughts 
darkness unfolding <LINE1> plaques and tangles spreading wide <LINE2> loved ones lose their minds 
bright summer sunshine <LINE1> i own this day so divine <LINE2> my choices are mine 
aches to give you up  <LINE1> fly with your beautiful wings  <LINE2> you were never mine 
warm rays touch skin <LINE1> icy air stings as wind blows <LINE2> sunny winter day 
as i receive praise <LINE1> i grant myself confidence <LINE2> yet remain humble 
vladimir putin <LINE1> keeps his spare roubles in a <LINE2> winnie the pooh tin 
a youthful car but <LINE1> aging face with frazzled hair <LINE2> rebelling the truth 
why seventeen <LINE1> if it's short nobody gives <LINE2> a damn haiku 
lying on her side <LINE1> book in hand she scans the page <LINE2> then turns to face me 
the first cup of tea <LINE1> dusting away the cobwebs <LINE2> waking up my mind 
envy and worry  <LINE1> permeate my thoughts today  <LINE2> though not productive 
like a living ghost <LINE1> the old blind cat who follows <LINE2> every sound i make 
overnight flight home <LINE1> landing soon in amsterdam <LINE2> patriotic eyes 
striking up the band <LINE1> the twang of whining and the <LINE2> sour notes of complaint 
i am in charge here <LINE1> i volunteered for this job <LINE2> please listen to me 
beginning to end <LINE1> inevitable at hand <LINE2> life goes on death comes 
shattered river ice <LINE1> sews itself back together <LINE2> scars replace her breasts 
times shared remembered <LINE1> handing you to god's embrace <LINE2> friend thanks for your love 
i find it freeing <LINE1> the constraints of the format <LINE2> eliminates waste 
out into the woods <LINE1> a man searching for meaning <LINE2> finds only himself 
just get me to work <LINE1> you need new brakes yes i know <LINE2> cold cold car please start 
unhindered carefree <LINE1> sang the birds their joyful songs <LINE2> despite the cold rain 
raindrops are falling <LINE1> god is crying all night long <LINE2> face hidden by clouds 
i feel emptied out <LINE1>  how'd i end up here anyone <LINE2>  a new lost spirit 
we were enemies <LINE1> the pain brought us together <LINE2> how are we so close 
tattoo studio <LINE1> the talented artist works <LINE2> a new butterfly 
we remember you <LINE1> our tears like tears lost in rain <LINE2> dear rutger hauer 
ink washing out blood <LINE1> spirit stronger than the flesh <LINE2> but not all survive 
humid city nights <LINE1>  continuously shuffling <LINE2>  of feet on asphalt 
if i am a tree <LINE1> but your love is with the sea <LINE2> make a ship of me 
two bathrooms enough <LINE1> until smartphones turned toilets <LINE2> into reading chairs 
is spring not just an <LINE1>  awakening of the earth <LINE2>  from the deepest dream 
a crow flew upwards <LINE1> camouflaged in the dark clouds <LINE2> thinking thunder song 
what happened to you <LINE1> are you sure you're ok <LINE2> blurred reality 
give your meat a tug <LINE1> put it between some nice buns <LINE2> enjoy some pulled pork 
lily pad playgrounds <LINE1> amphibians hopscotching <LINE2> to croaked hors d'oeuvres 
power cut <LINE1> we reach mordor <LINE2> by candlelight 
where are you now huh <LINE1> the juliet left the romeo <LINE2> didn't end the play 
you do not fear death <LINE1> perhaps you are ignorant <LINE2> enlighten yourself 
today's endless joy <LINE1>  chose to be a slow runner <LINE2>  rather than a slug 
spinning in circles <LINE1> attempting to get things done <LINE2> making easy hard 
i must not cannot <LINE1> be alone when the freezing <LINE2> snows of winter bite 
golden fall the leaves <LINE1> may the sun shine on your path <LINE2> and farewell she said 
it's all in our heads <LINE1>  infinite universes <LINE2>  and parallel worlds 
grey skies masked by clouds <LINE1> light coming through still the sun's <LINE2> bright requires no blue 
under an eclipsed sky <LINE1>  a new flower blooms <LINE2>  will it be first will it be last 
purrs vibrate my chest <LINE1> mr rogers needs my warmth <LINE2> human space heater 
pk fire from ness <LINE1> you are trapped but must escape <LINE2> got to di fast 
a cascade of light <LINE1> sun beams peering through the clouds <LINE2> reminders of hope 
pandemic had spread <LINE1> it ain't death that i dread but <LINE2> the words left unsaid 
once upon a time <LINE1> at the end of a rainbow <LINE2> miles found a trumpet 
i survived deadpool <LINE1>  you're not daredevil sorry <LINE2>  amused he spared me 
a taste of rye <LINE1> a taste of rum <LINE2> and a distaste of self 
rains bring pains again <LINE1> but old scars will fade from skin <LINE2> you are a good friend 
i just can't escape <LINE1> trust me when i say i've tried <LINE2> i won't forget you 
love in chaos <LINE1> can you see it too <LINE2> forever my thanksgiving 
there is another <LINE1> beside you in the fire <LINE2> you stand together 
all alone pitch black <LINE1> in my bed the thoughts evolve <LINE2> fiending for resolve 
pitch black and eerie <LINE1> through the window silent night <LINE2> but eyes stare both ways 
sweet dreams beckon me <LINE1>  but racing thoughts keep me chained <LINE2>  so i can't follow 
the icy wind blows <LINE1> so much coldness towards me <LINE2> can't react in kind 
beautiful flowers <LINE1> chilly winds blow them away <LINE2> swiftly life proceeds 
i had a dream once <LINE1> joy sorrow triumph and loss <LINE2> turns out it was life 
i miss that feeling <LINE1> before you knew who i was <LINE2> can we just go back 
two longing hearts met <LINE1> remembering past lives lived <LINE2> the two became one 
what are the chances <LINE1> such as my circumstances <LINE2> i need the answers 
some insomnia <LINE1>  i can dream my days away <LINE2>  and worry through nights 
the tallest flower <LINE1> be it by chance or by fate <LINE2> gets the most sunlight 
stems retreat the earth <LINE1> a desperate climb for light <LINE2> frozen yet flowing 
night has calmed the heat <LINE1> shining moon guards the sky path <LINE2> ghosts stir anxiously 
i'll never forget <LINE1> running my hands through your hair <LINE2> while you look at me 
you were everything <LINE1> i shut you off i'm sorry <LINE2> sunrise in her eyes 
the secrets you share <LINE1> shall soon return to shame you <LINE2> trust no one my friends 
laughter among friends <LINE1> feelings circling in the air <LINE2> dearest memory 
earth and sky melded <LINE1> the binding that calls down rain <LINE2> petrichor smell'd it 
my heart beats faster <LINE1> your sweet smile brightens my day <LINE2> when you pass by me 
the feeling has changed <LINE1> from a sinkhole to a cave <LINE2> a radiant void 
freedom is not free <LINE1> through fall frost and spring we fought <LINE2> summer will return 
the patter of rain <LINE1> gusts of wind blow through my room <LINE2> free for the moment 
plastic and gases <LINE1> unnatural minerals <LINE2> planet consumers 
the waves look beautiful <LINE1>  i know can do this <LINE2>  gotta avoid the rocks though 
somewhere in the world <LINE1> someone is building a chair <LINE2> someone else is dead 
cassandra's prophecy <LINE1>  the lemon flower is sweet <LINE2>  but the fruit of its is impossible to eat 
i miss you but i <LINE1> don't miss you i love you still <LINE2> but i don't like you 
no time left to spare <LINE1> through an isolating time <LINE2> silent they suffer 
oh crow in the field <LINE1> fly away now fly away <LINE2> into the future 
use efficient words <LINE1> seven syllables go here <LINE2> five for first and last 
steel mountain skyline <LINE1> red lights flicker and twinkle <LINE2> living city streets 
this girl is thirsty <LINE1> and it's starting to show this <LINE2> is not a good look 
fighting dont resolve <LINE1> do not fight in life ever <LINE2> love live do not hate 
one toe swims across <LINE1> the pool's smooth surface shimmer <LINE2> broken by crisp cracked skin 
drop falls after drop <LINE1> reading the tracks of your tears <LINE2> parallel poems 
dynasty of hate <LINE1> a lineage of evil <LINE2> beguiled by blood 
planes and trains arrive <LINE1> an agreement yet to come <LINE2> high road untraveled 
i am full of hate <LINE1>  hot yearning for things to end <LINE2>  let's kill each other 
on my tongue flutters <LINE1> rain on rooftops a drainpipe <LINE2> drunken thoughts insanity 
monochrome maiden <LINE1> if you want to be happy <LINE2> be sisyphus weeps 
i hate haikus <LINE1> they do not even rhyme <LINE2> how do they work 
got high holy veins <LINE1> my reflection full of shame <LINE2> i've been here too long 
to you everything <LINE1> is a spider leg broken <LINE2> off above the knee 
the dark sky of night <LINE1> is illuminated by <LINE2> the pale crescent moon 
upon the ocean <LINE1> i labour for my future <LINE2> one day it will come 
withered flowers cry <LINE1> ringing ears distract the mind <LINE2> asphyxiation 
it hasn't even <LINE1> been a week since i lost you <LINE2> i miss everything 
tears are a signal <LINE1>  they explain how far you reach <LINE2>  deep into my chest 
the scary things i see <LINE1> are projections of the me <LINE2> i don't want to be 
count love memories <LINE1>  everyone keeps something <LINE2> the flame peace revenge 
see what's looking back <LINE1>  a welcome escape from all <LINE2>  wash the fear away 
i throw the dog's ball <LINE1> into the lantana bush <LINE2> petals everywhere 
stark cold gray hallway <LINE1> body bags are near the morgue <LINE2> but one starts to move 
an ecosystem <LINE1> as vast as the amazon <LINE2> in a box outside 
stringing pretty lights <LINE1> their phosphorescent flash is <LINE2> christmas in july 
cat's eyes filled with night <LINE1> bright yellow moon lights the sky <LINE2> the stars stream o'erhead 
tiny taps on earth <LINE1> what a newfound background sound <LINE2> to my lonely days 
surprise a challenge <LINE1> obstacles with each step now <LINE2> grace sought here it comes 
i've diabetes <LINE1> that's not cash money of life <LINE2> i've shidded my pants 
i echo father <LINE1> so similar while alive <LINE2> i hope not in death 
your life changed my life <LINE1> god's love for us seen in you <LINE2> ever loving you 
it is wings not rings <LINE1> that entangle our souls and <LINE2> weld us together 
like hidden termites <LINE1> we only see their progress <LINE2> when the house falls down 
from where comes the nerve <LINE1> hey you can you stay inside <LINE2> help flatten the curve 
deep the memories <LINE1> currents of time so swift <LINE2> loving our journey 
these people around me <LINE1> freely breathing easily <LINE2> why am i drowning 
july sixty nine <LINE1> curious moths and street lamps <LINE2> armstrong on the moon 
cloud tinted windows <LINE1> with glass panes fogged by the ages <LINE2> obscures scene with time 
a yawing freighter <LINE1> rocking starboard and port is <LINE2> bowing down to sleep 
i know just enough <LINE1> to know that i don't know much <LINE2> except i love you 
the bent willow tree <LINE1> sheds its leaves into the stream <LINE2> why are you weeping 
hours are ticking by <LINE1> i check the clock once again <LINE2> turns out only minutes 
getting zombie eyes <LINE1> from being dead inside while <LINE2> still being alive 
short eternities <LINE1>  my escape from kindred demons <LINE2>  silence no more lies 
morning espresso <LINE1> accelerating the mind <LINE2> and bowel alike 
anger can consume <LINE1> white hot lava soon to cool <LINE2> sadness just lingers 
not so serious <LINE1> extravagant efforts fail <LINE2> be like the water 
the afternoon winds <LINE1> pushing the freshly risen sails <LINE2> waking up stretching out 
haikus are easy  <LINE1> you just have to say some things <LINE2> and count how many 
detached from myself <LINE1> grounded by the ceiling i <LINE2> suffocate in snow 
eyes start to water <LINE1>  impending sneeze incoming <LINE2>  i hate allergies 
the angel's cold tears <LINE1> calls for the land's protector <LINE2> but no one answers 
i'm very hungry <LINE1> but am having too much fun <LINE2> video games starve 
exam tomorrow <LINE1> anxiety rolling in <LINE2> paralyzing me 
focus clarity <LINE1> daily my view is improved <LINE2> such hints of wonder 
a warm lambent glow <LINE1> peaking through shadowy bush <LINE2> a new day to come 
sensing five fingers <LINE1> each open understanding <LINE2> xenial right now 
my head swims with emotion <LINE1>  your kisses do that <LINE2>  melt me again and again 
you are wearing me <LINE1> out like a fashion statement <LINE2> abuse is en vogue 
the birch tree waiting <LINE1> with bare branches shivering <LINE2> the nightingales song 
in the midnight hour <LINE1> falling short and wandering <LINE2> you broke through to me 
salt stains on suede shoes <LINE1> sweaters soaked by soggy snow <LINE2> winter's welcome wanes 
somewhere over the <LINE1> rainbow way up high there's a <LINE2> land that i've heard of  
sitting here with you <LINE1>  every sweeping glance you make <LINE2>  takes my breath away 
my cat weighed two stone <LINE1> the humming birds remember <LINE2> the branches she reached 
all the world's a stage <LINE1>  implying i have a part <LINE2>  but i have no script 
how do people still <LINE1> make original haikus <LINE2> you'd think we'd run out 
called to follow you <LINE1> eyes on you is all it takes <LINE2> all else fades away 
i can teach you everything  <LINE1> said the master <LINE2> and said no more 
fairytale darkness <LINE1> lingers on his lips music <LINE2> pied pipers arrives 
the day continued <LINE1> with no care of how i felt <LINE2> my soul slowly died 
the thirst is the worst <LINE1> when the sun fell down at last <LINE2> i drank water first 
how many hipsters <LINE1> to change a lightbulb it's a <LINE2> small obscure number 
he did lose his aunt <LINE1> does he see me as his friend <LINE2> i care about him 
sharks are swimming in <LINE1> an ocean of snow by his <LINE2> dorsal fins of ice 
on a pale spring day <LINE1> one rhinoceros beetle <LINE2> feasting on fig tarts 
a cold wintry night <LINE1> overcome by warm morning <LINE2> with mighty purpose 
midnight still awake <LINE1> while the rest of the house sleeps <LINE2> i dread tomorrow 
don't paint the rainbow <LINE1>  it's colors are everywhere  <LINE2> experience it 
i tried on my mask <LINE1> my mother sewed it by herself <LINE2> once curtain fabric 
vibrations meet sand <LINE1>  the grains dance accordingly <LINE2>  illustrating sound 
god's hand see it now <LINE1> reach out connect rise with joy <LINE2> always there for you 
we breathe the same air <LINE1> feeling the the same cool clean sheets <LINE2> inside each other 
my time not wasted <LINE1> pining for impossible <LINE2> all it cost was hope 
seeking fellowship <LINE1>  as hard as it may become <LINE2>  destiny awaits 
a tale of brothers <LINE1> saving people hunting things <LINE2> supernatural 
freetime is freed time <LINE1> it will flee you must hold it <LINE2> and use it with care 
just got laid off work <LINE1>  since coronavirus sucks <LINE2> surrounded by idiots 
draped in his own flag <LINE1> the war removed everything <LINE2> finally he's home 
you told me you were bad <LINE1> my mistakes have taught me that <LINE2> i should believe you 
destined to descend <LINE1> leaving a path of silver <LINE2> usher of winter 
partner still snoring <LINE1> blankets pulled up to my chin <LINE2> first dawn of the year 
one billion flashlights <LINE1> shine down from the winter sky <LINE2> onto sleeping tents 
the armored beetle <LINE1>  paddles through the reflection <LINE2> climbs out and dives back 
i found you wilting <LINE1> damn the sun i will hide you <LINE2> but come back to life 
nothing left to give <LINE1> like the final syllable <LINE2> i disappear 
his balls were dangling <LINE1> like the eternal apples of <LINE2> the eternal tree 
you can see the scars <LINE1> where the sharp words cut this line <LINE2> into three pieces 
it finally sets <LINE1> amongst the thin suffering clouds <LINE2> oh where is my mind 
swift fat drops of rain <LINE1>  complimenting summers end <LINE2>  as autumn begins 
the park weekday nights <LINE1> kids and dogs trample wet grass <LINE2> last days of summer 
small conflict and yet <LINE1> days of silence is better <LINE2> than saying sorry 
melancholic mood <LINE1> rain falls with sadness in bloom <LINE2> every lie came true 
easily wounded <LINE1> he sits and waits for something <LINE2> that will never come 
i can't miss ever <LINE1> i'm the motherfucking man <LINE2> i will never miss 
in blueberry woods <LINE1> yellow raincoat purple tongue <LINE2> i breathe in the rain 
it was destiny <LINE1> ship was born to die in sea <LINE2> won't forget you jack 
water is dripping <LINE1> echoing into a pan <LINE2> driving me crazy 
castles in the sky <LINE1> above blue ridge sentinels <LINE2> bathed in golden hues 
they say make a wish <LINE1> upon the first twilight star <LINE2> already have you 
chitown musical <LINE1> no words stop no words stop my <LINE2> elevated train 
rough tattoo artist <LINE1> talked about church of satan <LINE2> one a m bar talk 
sneezing and sniffing <LINE1> in cootie bug cubicles <LINE2> partitioned our cold 
lunch break walks fill me <LINE1>  the flowers and dogs and kids <LINE2>  alas i head back 
the ice has melted <LINE1> everywhere that i can see <LINE2> except my garden 
kauaian coffee <LINE1> steams my reading glasses <LINE2> birds squirrels deer come say hi 
i sit on my chair <LINE1> reliving the past <LINE2> i cannot let go 
why yes i believe <LINE1> that it was satan in me <LINE2> gave me eyes to see 
if you are alone <LINE1> just remember this haiku <LINE2> and i'm there with you 
and to what extent <LINE1> will these ceaseless dreams be lived <LINE2> we all are waiting 
i love you for real <LINE1>  always know this love is real <LINE2>  because i am here 
when a good friend leaves <LINE1> a piece of them still remains <LINE2> forever with you 
my ass is heavy <LINE1> it feels like anvil with legs <LINE2> my ass really hurts 
sometimes i feel it <LINE1> this my city of angels <LINE2> is my only friend 
it comes once a year <LINE1> so celebrate with a pie <LINE2> it's three point one four 
pasty like raw dough <LINE1> soft light downey flesh on mine <LINE2> i love you pillow 
feeling stuck too long <LINE1> seeking change in scenery <LINE2> venture down new path 
all of my grieving <LINE1> happened during the summer <LINE2> so you wouldn't see 
i am in great pain <LINE1> flashed before me a good life <LINE2> i am now at peace 
i got high off your <LINE1> fumes and chemicals and i <LINE2> took too much too much 
i lie here in bed <LINE1>  wondering if all this dread <LINE2>  is just in my head 
poison on my lips <LINE1> life starts to drain from my face <LINE2> and you just smile 
cthulhu sees all <LINE1> death and destruction shall come <LINE2> he can not be stopped 
drink before you drive <LINE1> things can go south really fast <LINE2> be careful okay 
stargazing jumpers <LINE1> adrift on quantum fables <LINE2> filaments of fate 
i'm super stinky <LINE1>  to mosquitoes around me <LINE2>  i'm a smelly food 
living with regret <LINE1> keep wishing i could go back <LINE2> i should have kissed you 
i wish i was not <LINE1> always so lonely while <LINE2> standing in a crowd 
you appear charming <LINE1> and careless but i know the <LINE2> chaos that you hide 
silently she sings <LINE1> a song of serene sadness <LINE2> but she's just a rock 
held his cotton hand <LINE1> and warmth flooded me stronger <LINE2> than any other man 
an early snowfall <LINE1> drains warmth from the flower pot <LINE2> cat curls up in bed 
five seven and five <LINE1> i could never count that well <LINE2> why all that damn math 
words like a flower <LINE1> convey more to the male soul <LINE2> than a cow patty 
my rational side <LINE1> rides shotgun windows down with <LINE2> the radio on 
the way of rudolph <LINE1> misfit finds friendship love home <LINE2> red glow from inside 
brocaded clouds are <LINE1> from the house of autumn and <LINE2> dress a purple sky 
through thick and thin friends <LINE1> there for you no matter what <LINE2> i thought i had two 
insolence pervades <LINE1> so reprimand my buttocks <LINE2> don't spare the rattan 
tree branches shiver <LINE1> squirrel silent in midair <LINE2> tree branches shiver 
nett ish nett aber <LINE1> schadenfreude schmecht mir gut <LINE2> so süß wie honig 
heed this prophecy <LINE1>  we're all destined for greatness <LINE2> learn to know thyself 
blinds melon eye <LINE1> jungle juice choose <LINE2> your green machine 
all up in yo' house <LINE1> with my feet upon the couch <LINE2> eff yo' couch biotch 
her name was karen <LINE1> wanted to see her again <LINE2> manager i have become 
to discourage mice <LINE1> the kitchen is kept well cleaned <LINE2> such orderliness 
calm and balanced thought <LINE1> harmony follows the plot <LINE2> good actor of life 
eyes are wide open <LINE1> i scream unable to go back <LINE2> irreversible 
dawn drips on the trees <LINE1> ripples of black meet the eye <LINE2> wind breathes relieved sigh 
invisible hand <LINE1> that one finger you raise up <LINE2> the poor clearly see 
a v then a j <LINE1> geese cross the darkening sky <LINE2> moon on the river 
how hard can it be <LINE1> to string some words together <LINE2>  and call it haiku 
dear andromeda <LINE1> you sit just within our grasp <LINE2> yet so far away 
a sudden rush of <LINE1>  euphoria the fleeting <LINE2>  runner's high is here 
dead faces occupying my brain <LINE1> i was too slow <LINE2> my battle buddy is dead 
and when our lips met <LINE1> we both remembered the sea  <LINE2> anchovy kisses 
i look in your eyes <LINE1> and find my gaze drifting down <LINE2> where your lips await 
french is retarded <LINE1>  french is the gayest language <LINE2>  now i want die 
don't let me say this <LINE1> i love you for all you are <LINE2> heart soul hands and smile 
the fog lingers low <LINE1> dimming the colours of life <LINE2> a monochrome cloak 
i slept like garbage <LINE1> i should staple my eyes shut <LINE2> sun won't shine anymore 
she tracks her gray ghost <LINE1> footprints she believes too much <LINE2> and i too little 
radiant fuzz ball <LINE1> bursts to thousands with the wind <LINE2> parachutes descend 
today i'm alone <LINE1> tomorrow i have to work <LINE2> though just as alone 
displaying patience <LINE1> the spider waits for its prey <LINE2> death gives way to life 
life is fleeting fast <LINE1> memories slip as time flies <LINE2> live with no regrets 
today a setback <LINE1> your pain permeates my thoughts <LINE2> why this path my lord 
the dough has risen <LINE1> and soon the oven will yield <LINE2> a warm loaf of bread 
chicken bacon ranch <LINE1> oh that adds up to seven <LINE2> would ya look at that 
psychedelia <LINE1> underneath the green christmas <LINE2> tree my friends love me 
walls can you hear me <LINE1> the trees weren't talking either <LINE2> everyone hates me 
huh huh huh huh huh <LINE1>  huh huh huh m huh huh m <LINE2>  huh huh m uh huh 
took a dandelion <LINE1> for it to forgive herself <LINE2> now she looks prettier 
start another day <LINE1> i feel tired not worth it <LINE2>  start another day 
dead humming meadow <LINE1> thorny vines constrict the oak <LINE2> falls down the soldier 
a black paper moon <LINE1> for me she destroyed the stars <LINE2> our souls are forfeit 
i would love to know <LINE1> what a hot pocket tastes like <LINE2> without a burnt tongue 
face through misty glass <LINE1> who is it a bell chimes back <LINE2> crimson specks in snow 
we could never be <LINE1> you were just a dream and i <LINE2> was your fantasy 
maybe i'm a ghost  <LINE1> i hope we can spend more time <LINE2> does it hurt so fine 
this sweet little hate <LINE1> is but a fleeting feeling <LINE2> greed burns within us 
daytime bathes us in light <LINE1> light brings us the stress of life <LINE2> we long for the darkness 
emphasis matters <LINE1> say it in canadian <LINE2> it's montessori 
the nights grow shorter <LINE1> yet i remain in darkness <LINE2> please turn the light on 
moving furniture <LINE1> kills me as i save money <LINE2> wawa overdose 
creative lifetime <LINE1> now artifacts circulate <LINE2> we make just to share 
once again such pain <LINE1> slows me down but i endure <LINE2> offered up for you 
atrium is full <LINE1> aggressively shitting birds <LINE2> a ruined new hat 
a man with no shoes <LINE1> met a man who had no feet <LINE2> and he was humbled 
the earth is dying <LINE1> we're only getting older <LINE2> listen to your heart 
the tide washes out <LINE1> memories of us both here <LINE2> tracks gone from the sand 
pain inside my chest <LINE1> another one down the hatch <LINE2> crying out to god 
i don't belong here <LINE1> noone is the same as me <LINE2> i must be myself 
chatting on my phone <LINE1>  like i have nothing to do <LINE2> but to talk with you 
i must clean my room <LINE1> my cellphone beckons to me <LINE2> scroll and see and like 
faith hidden within <LINE1> listenhear looksee believe <LINE2> he does it for you 
been more then a year <LINE1> everyone says to move on <LINE2> i fucking miss you 
glowing horizon <LINE1>  sun emerges from the trees <LINE2> elation of birds 
anniversaries <LINE1> today makes fifteen for us <LINE2> that's sixty seasons 
the carnivore blues <LINE1> sink into lenten mush with <LINE2> aching incisors 
saw you in a dream <LINE1> and said we really have to <LINE2> stop meeting like this 
there are things i knew <LINE1> but i no longer know them <LINE2> brain leaks still not fixed 
us through thick and thin <LINE1> of late times a bit thinner <LINE2> but love lays plenty 
where is my haiku <LINE1> i know i posted it here <LINE2> oh look six upvotes 
don't fuck with someone <LINE1> else's feelings because you're <LINE2> unsure about yours 
with father imbued <LINE1> the son rises each morning <LINE2> guided by spirit 
my poop smells awful <LINE1>  i should go to the doctor <LINE2>  or stop eating eggs 
potent sleeping pills <LINE1> medically induced rest <LINE2> yet i cannot dream 
share meeple castles <LINE1> creative seven letters <LINE2> always pick tiles first 
it stores food in cold <LINE1> as to prevent rot and mold <LINE2> refrigerator 
three soar <LINE1>  blackfeathered their circle <LINE2>  below dirty heavens 
lusting for water <LINE1> i reach into my backpack <LINE2> oops ten miles left 
did you guys know that <LINE1> reddit has a haiku bot <LINE2> it must love this sub 
cornucopias <LINE1> thin white vertical incense <LINE2> first honeysuckles 
i notice the heat <LINE1> a lonely light flickering <LINE2> surviving the night 
you loved horror <LINE1>  chocolate chip pancakes we shared <LINE2>  diabetes came 
everything is black <LINE1> i just want to be happy <LINE2> it will never be 
life weighs heavy a <LINE1> long way ahead steep it goes <LINE2> yet it glows golden 
oyster world limits <LINE1> unwillingly bound to earth <LINE2> yearning for the stars 
invisible strings <LINE1> are attached to all of us <LINE2> and all tangled up 
poised on the platform <LINE1> her swam dive in trees with the <LINE2> bridge as a spring board 
haikus help me think <LINE1> momentary concise thoughts <LINE2> sealed with a ribbon 
clouds shredded by wind <LINE1> wet feet for man in the moon <LINE2> willows still weeping 
dwelling in a vowel <LINE1> and a scrubby consonant <LINE2> spelling out sparrows 
truth proclaimed lived <LINE1> an example for us all <LINE2> fueling my hope 
a duel of the leaves <LINE1>  both are promptly defeated <LINE2>  the snow covers them 
mods removing posts <LINE1>  is reminiscent of days <LINE2>  gone by book burnings 
an otter went down <LINE1> into the glassy water <LINE2> to catch her breakfast 
do not waste your time <LINE1> and know that without failure <LINE2> you cannot improve 
begging my way back <LINE1> another night on this road <LINE2> i gaze at the moon 
keep this in your mind. <LINE1> only after the clouds cry, <LINE2> will the rainbow come
